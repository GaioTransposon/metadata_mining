Here, we developed an alternative approach in which the complex soil microbiome was broken into components (""functional modules""), based on metabolic capacities, for individual characterization. We hypothesized that reproducible, low-complexity communities that represent functional modules could be obtained through targeted enrichments and that, in combination, they would encompass a large extent of the soil microbiome diversity. Enrichments were performed on a starting soil inoculum with defined media based on specific carbon substrates, antibiotics, alternative electron acceptors under anaerobic conditions, or alternative growing conditions reflective of common field stresses. The resultant communities were evaluated through 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. Less permissive modules (anaerobic conditions, complex polysaccharides, and certain stresses) resulted in more distinct community profiles with higher richness and more variability between replicates, whereas modules with simple substrates were dominated by fewer species and were more reproducible. Collectively, approximately 27% of unique taxa present in the liquid soil extract control were found across functional modules. Taxa that were underrepresented or undetected in the source soil were also enriched across the modules. Metatranscriptomic analyses were carried out on a subset of the modules to investigate differences in functional gene expression. These results demonstrate that by dissecting the soil microbiome into discrete components it is possible to obtain a more comprehensive view of the soil microbiome and its biochemical potential than would be possible using more holistic analyses.IMPORTANCE The taxonomic and functional diversity inherent to the soil microbiome complicate assessments of the metabolic potential carried out by the community members. An alternative approach is to break down the soil microbiome into reduced-complexity subsets based on metabolic capacities (functional modules) prior to sequencing and analysis. Here, we demonstrate that this approach successfully identified specific phylogenetic and biochemical traits of the soil microbiome that otherwise remained hidden from a more top-down analysis.",soil,,

However, Bt cotton cultivation left Bt toxin residues in the soil, resulting in a response by its microbiome that caused potential environmental risks. In this research, the metagenomics analysis was performed to investigate the structure and functions of the soil bacterial community in the Bt cotton field from the Binzhou, Shandong province of China, where the Bt cotton has been cultivated for over fifteen years. Analysis of the function genes proved that the receptors of Bt toxins were absent in the soil bacteria and Bt toxins failed to target the soil bacteria. The microbiome structure and function were highly influenced by Bt cotton cultivation, however, no significant change in the total abundance of the bacteria was observed. Proteobacteria was the largest taxonomic group in the soil bacterial (42-52%) and its abundance was significantly increased after Bt cotton cultivation. The increase of Proteobacteria abundance resulted in an increase in ABC transporters gene abundance, indicating the improved ability of detoxification metabolism over Bt cotton cultivation. Xanthomonadales could be a biomarker of the Bt cotton group, whose abundance was significantly increased to contribute to the increase of the genes abundance in ABC transporters. The abundance of apoptosis genes was significantly decreased, and it might be related to the increase of Proteobacteria abundance by Bt cotton cultivation. In addition, Myxococcales was responsible for carotenoid biosynthesis, whoes genes abundance was significantly decreased due to the decrease of Myxococcales abundance by Bt cotton cultivation. These changes in soil bacterial community structure and functions indicate the influence by Bt cotton cultivation, leading to an understanding of the bacteria colonization patterns due to successive years of Bt cotton cultivation. These research results should be significant for the rational risk assessment of Bt cotton cultivation.",soil,,

It encompasses large proportion of microscopic biodiversity, including prokaryotes and the microscopic eukaryotes. Soil microbiome is critical in managing the soil functions, but their activities have diminutive recognition in few systems like desert land and forest ecosystems. Soil microbiome is highly dependent on abiotic and biotic factors like pH, carbon content, soil structure, texture, and vegetation, but it can notably vary with ecosystems and the respective inhabitants. Thus, unboxing this black box is essential to comprehend the basic components adding to the soil systems and supported ecosystem services. Recent advancements in the field of molecular microbial ecology have delivered commanding tools to examine this genetic trove of soil biodiversity. Objective of this review is to provide a critical evaluation of the work on the soil microbiome, especially since the advent of the NGS techniques. The review also focuses on advances in our understanding of soil communities, their interactions, and functional capabilities along with understanding their role in maneuvering the biogeochemical cycle while underlining and tapping the unprecedented metagenomics data to infer the ecological attributes of yet undiscovered soil microbiome. This review focuses key research directions that could shape the future of basic and applied research into the soil microbiome. This review has led us to understand that it is difficult to generalize that soil microbiome plays a substantiated role in shaping the soil networks and it is indeed a vital resource for sustaining the ecosystem functioning. Exploring soil microbiome will help in unlocking their roles in various soil network. It could be resourceful in exploring and forecasting its impacts on soil systems and for dealing with alleviating problems like rapid climate change.",soil,,

ResCap is a novel targeted-metagenomic approach that allows the detection of minority components of the resistome gene pool without the cost-prohibitive coverage depths and can provide a valuable tool to study the spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in the environment. We used high-throughput sequencing and qPCR for 16S rRNA gene fragments as well as ResCap to explore the dynamics of bacteria, and ARGs introduced to soils and adjacent water ditches, both at community and individual scale, over a period of three weeks. The soil bacteriome and resistome showed strong resilience to the input of manure, as manuring did not impact the overall structure of the bacteriome, and its effects on the resistome were transient. Initially, manure application resulted in a substantial increase of ARGs in soils and adjacent waters, while not affecting the overall bacterial community composition. Still, specific families increased after manure application, either through the input of manure (e.g., Dysgonomonadaceae) or through enrichment after manuring (e.g., Pseudomonadaceae). Depending on the type of ARG, manure application resulted mostly in an increase (e.g., aph(6)-Id), but occasionally also in a decrease (e.g., dfrB3) of the absolute abundance of ARG clusters (FPKM/kg or L). This study shows that the structures of the bacteriome and resistome are shaped by different factors, where the bacterial community composition could not explain the changes in ARG diversity or abundances. Also, it highlights the potential of applying targeted metagenomic techniques, such as ResCap, to study the fate of AMR in the environment.",soil,,

In this article, original data on the influence of a jet-fuel spillage on the topsoil properties are presented. The data set is obtained during a one-year long pot and field experiments with Dystric Arenosols, Fibric Histosols and Albic Luvisols. Kerosene loads were 1, 5, 10, 25 and 100 g/kg. The data set includes information about temporal changes in kerosene concentration; physicochemical properties, such as рН, moisture, cation exchange capacity, content of soil organic matter, available P and K, exchangeable NH4 +, and water-soluble NO3 -; and biological properties, such as biological consumption of oxygen, and cellulolytic activity.

The consequences of these microbial transfers are unclear and understudied. On dairy farms, the storage of cow manure in manure pits and subsequent application to field soil as a fertilizer may facilitate the spread of the mammalian gut microbiome and its associated ARGs to the environment. To determine the extent of both taxonomic and resistance similarity during these transitions, we collected fresh manure, manure from pits, and field soil across 15 different dairy farms for three consecutive seasons. We used a combination of shotgun metagenomic sequencing and functional metagenomics to quantitatively interrogate taxonomic and ARG compositional variation on farms. We found that as the microbiome transitions from fresh dairy cow manure to manure pits, microbial taxonomic compositions and resistance profiles experience distinct restructuring, including decreases in alpha diversity and shifts in specific ARG abundances that potentially correspond to fresh manure going from a gut-structured community to an environment-structured community. Further, we did not find evidence of shared microbial community or a transfer of ARGs between manure and field soil microbiomes. Our results suggest that fresh manure experiences a compositional change in manure pits during storage and that the storage of manure in manure pits does not result in a depletion of ARGs. We did not find evidence of taxonomic or ARG restructuring of soil microbiota with the application of manure to field soils, as soil communities remained resilient to manure-induced perturbation.IMPORTANCE The addition of dairy cow manure-stored in manure pits-to field soil has the potential to introduce not only organic nutrients but also mammalian microbial communities and antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) to soil communities. Using shotgun sequencing paired with functional metagenomics, we showed that microbial community composition changed between fresh manure and manure pit samples with a decrease in gut-associated pathobionts, while ARG abundance and diversity remained high. However, field soil communities were distinct from those in manure in both microbial taxonomic and ARG composition. These results broaden our understanding of the transfer of microbial communities in agricultural settings and suggest that field soil microbial communities are resilient against the deposition of ARGs or microbial communities from manure.",soil,,

To understand the key metabolic processes involved in soil phytic acid utilization, we analyzed rhizosphere soil microbial communities using molecular ecological approaches. Although molecular fingerprint analysis revealed changes in the rhizosphere soil microbial communities from bulk soil microbial community, no clear relationship between the microbiome composition and flowering status that might be related to phytic acid utilization of L. japonicus could be determined. However, metagenomic analysis revealed changes in the relative abundance of the classes Bacteroidetes, Betaproteobacteria, Chlorobi, Dehalococcoidetes and Methanobacteria, which include strains that potentially promote plant growth and phytic acid utilization, and some gene clusters relating to phytic acid utilization, such as alkaline phosphatase and citrate synthase, with the phytic acid utilization status of the plant. This study highlights phylogenetic and metabolic features of the microbial community of the L. japonicus rhizosphere and provides a basic understanding of how rhizosphere microbial communities affect the phytic acid status in soil.",soil,,

The response of soil microbiomes to kerosene pollution is still poorly understood. Here, we model the impact of kerosene leakage on the composition of the topsoil microbiome in pot and field experiments with different loads of added kerosene (loads up to 100 g/kg; retention time up to 360 days). At four time points we measured kerosene concentration and sequenced variable regions of 16S ribosomal RNA in the microbial communities. Mainly alkaline Dystric Arenosols with low content of available phosphorus and soil organic matter had an increased fraction of Actinobacteriota, Firmicutes, Nitrospirota, Planctomycetota, and, to a lesser extent, Acidobacteriota and Verrucomicobacteriota. In contrast, in highly acidic Fibric Histosols, rich in soil organic matter and available phosphorus, the fraction of Acidobacteriota was higher, while the fraction of Actinobacteriota was lower. Albic Luvisols occupied an intermediate position in terms of both physicochemical properties and microbiome composition. The microbiomes of different soils show similar response to equal kerosene loads. In highly contaminated soils, the proportion of anaerobic bacteria-metabolizing hydrocarbons increased, whereas the proportion of aerobic bacteria decreased. During the field experiment, the soil microbiome recovered much faster than in the pot experiments, possibly due to migration of microorganisms from the polluted area. The microbial community of Fibric Histosols recovered in 6 months after kerosene had been loaded, while microbiomes of Dystric Arenosols and Albic Luvisols did not restore even after a year.",soil,,

Metagenomic DNA was extracted from soil samples representing the following treatments: (i) plough tillage with standard nitrogen fertilization and use of fungicides and growth regulators, (ii) plough tillage with reduced nitrogen fertilization (50%), (iii) cultivator tillage with standard nitrogen fertilization and use of fungicides and growth regulators, and (iv) cultivator tillage with reduced nitrogen fertilization (50%). Bulk soil (BS), as well as root-affected soil (RS), were considered for all treatments in replicates. HT-sequencing of metagenomic DNA yielded approx. 100 Giga bases (Gb) of sequence information. Taxonomic profiling of soil communities revealed the presence of 70 phyla, whereby Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Planctomycetes, Acidobacteria, Thaumarchaeota, Firmicutes, Verrucomicrobia and Chloroflexi feature abundances of more than 1%. Functional microbiome profiling uncovered, i.a., numerous potential plant-beneficial, plant-growth-promoting and biocontrol traits predicted to be involved in nutrient provision, phytohormone synthesis, antagonism against pathogens and signal molecule synthesis relevant in microbe-plant interaction. Neither taxonomic nor functional microbiome profiling based on single-read analyses revealed pronounced differences regarding the farming practices applied. Soil metagenome sequences were assembled and taxonomically binned. The ten most reliable and abundant Metagenomically Assembled Genomes (MAGs) were taxonomically classified and metabolically reconstructed. Importance of the phylum Thaumarchaeota for the analyzed microbiome is corroborated by the fact that the four corresponding MAGs were predicted to oxidize ammonia (nitrification), thus contributing to the cycling of nitrogen, and in addition are most probably able to fix carbon dioxide. Moreover, Thaumarchaeota and several bacterial MAGs also possess genes with predicted functions in plant-growth-promotion. Abundances of certain MAGs (species resolution level) responded to the tillage practice, whereas the factors compartment (BS vs. RS) and nitrogen fertilization only marginally shaped MAG abundance profiles. Hence, soil management regimes promoting plant-beneficial microbiome members are very likely advantageous for the respective agrosystem, its health and carbon sequestration and accordingly may enhance plant productivity. Since Chernozem soils are highly fertile, corresponding microbiome data represent a valuable reference resource for agronomy in general.",soil,,

      Fe-deficiency chlorosis (FDC) of Asian pear plants is widespread, but little is known about the association between the microbial communities in the rhizosphere soil and leaf chlorosis. The leaf mineral concentration, leaf subcellular structure, soil physiochemical properties, and bacterial species community and distribution had been analysed to gain insights into the FDC in Asian pear plant.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The total Fe in leaves with Fe-deficiency was positively correlated with total K, Mg, S, Cu, Zn, Mo and Cl contents, but no differences of available Fe (AFe) were detected between the rhizosphere soil of chlorotic and normal plants. Degraded ribosomes and degraded thylakloid stacks in chloroplast were observed in chlorotic leaves. The annotated microbiome indicated that there were 5 kingdoms, 52 phyla, 94 classes, 206 orders, 404 families, 1,161 genera, and 3,043 species in the rhizosphere soil of chlorotic plants; it was one phylum less and one order, 11 families, 59 genera, and 313 species more than in that of normal plant. Bacterial community and distribution patterns in the rhizosphere soil of chlorotic plants were distinct from those of normal plants and the relative abundance and microbiome diversity were more stable in the rhizosphere soils of normal than in chlorotic plants. Three (Nitrospira defluvii, Gemmatirosa kalamazoonesis, and Sulfuricella denitrificans) of the top five species (N. defluvii, G. kalamazoonesis, S. denitrificans, Candidatus Nitrosoarchaeum koreensis, and Candidatus Koribacter versatilis). were the identical and aerobic in both rhizosphere soils, but their relative abundance decreased by 48, 37, and 22%, respectively, and two of them (G. aurantiaca and Ca. S. usitatus) were substituted by an ammonia-oxidizing soil archaeon, Ca. N. koreensis and a nitrite and nitrate reduction related species, Ca. K. versatilis in that of chlorotic plants, which indicated the adverse soil aeration in the rhizosphere soil of chlorotic plants. A water-impermeable tables was found to reduce the soil aeration, inhibit root growth, and cause some absorption root death from infection by Fusarium solani.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      It was waterlogging or/and poor drainage of the soil may inhibit Fe uptake not the amounts of AFe in the rhizosphere soil of chlorotic plants that caused FDC in this study.",soil,,

To describe the taxonomic diversity and functional profiles of this environment, metagenomic DNA was extracted from a metagenomic library generated from the GDF. The DNA was shotgun-sequenced using Illumina and analyzed using the MG-RAST server. The diversity profile revealed that the most abundant domain was Bacteria (97.8%) followed by Archaea (1.12%), Eukaryota (1.02%) and Viruses (0.03%). Out of the 50 phyla present, the most abundant was Proteobacteria (41.6%) followed by Actinobacteria (18.7%) and Acidobacteria (7.06%).

The functional profile showed abundance of genes related to Carbohydrates (13.16%), Clustering-based subsystems (13.0%), Amino Acids and Derivatives (9.9%) and Protein Metabolism (8.24%). Furthermore, more specific grouping showed that NULL (21.5%) was the most abundant function group, followed by Plant-Prokaryote DOE project (6.05%), Protein biosynthesis (4.82%), Central carbohydrate metabolism (3.98%), DNA repair (2.72%) and Resistance to antibiotics and toxic compounds (2.66%).

The impacts of water-saving rice cultivation methods on rice methylmercury concentrations are uncertain. Rice (Oryza sativa L. cv. Nipponbare) was cultivated in fields using four water management treatments, including flooded (no dry-downs), alternating wetting and drying (AWD) (with one or three dry-downs), and furrow-irrigated fields (nine dry-downs) (n=16 fields). Anoxic bulk soil was collected from rice roots during the rice maturation phase, and rice grain was harvested after fields were dried. Total mercury and methylmercury concentrations were determined in soil and polished rice samples, and the soil microbiome was analyzed using 16S (v4) rRNA gene profiling. Soil total mercury did not differ between fields. However, compared to continuously flooded fields, soil and rice methylmercury concentrations averaged 51% and 38% lower in the AWD fields, respectively, and 95% and 96% lower in the furrow-irrigated fields, respectively. Compared to flooded fields, grain yield was reduced on average by <1% in the AWD fields and 34% in the furrow-irrigated fields. Additionally, using 16S (v4) rRNA gene profiling, the relative abundance of genera (i.e., highest resolution via this method) known to contain mercury methylators averaged 2.9-fold higher in flooded and AWD fields compared to furrow-irrigated fields. These results reinforce the benefits of AWD in reducing rice methylmercury concentrations with minimal changes in rice production yields. In the furrow-irrigated fields, a lower relative abundance of genera known to contain mercury methylators suggests an association between lower concentrations of soil and rice methylmercury and specific soil microbiomes.",soil,,

Composite wastewater samples (24 h) were collected weekly from a manhole between December 2020 and November 2021 in Maryland, USA. RT-qPCR results showed concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 RNA recovered from wastewater samples reflected incidence of COVID-19 cases. When a drastic increase in COVID-19 was detected in February 2021, samples were selected for microbiome analysis (DNA metagenomics, RNA metatranscriptomics, and targeted SARS-CoV-2 sequencing). Targeted SARS-CoV-2 sequencing allowed for detection of important genetic mutations, such as spike: K417N, D614G, P681H, T716I, S982A, and D1118H, commonly associated with increased cell entry and reinfection. Microbiome analysis (DNA and RNA) provided important insight with respect to human health-related factors, including detection of pathogens and their virulence/antibiotic resistance genes. Specific microbial species comprising the wastewater microbiome correlated with incidence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, suggesting potential association with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Climatic conditions, namely, temperature, were related to incidence of COVID-19 and detection of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater, having been monitored as part of an environmental risk score assessment carried out in this study. In summary, the wastewater microbiome provides useful public health information, and hence, a valuable tool to proactively detect and characterize pathogenic agents circulating in a community. In effect, metagenomics of wastewater can serve as an early warning system for communicable diseases, by providing a larger source of information for health departments and public officials. IMPORTANCE Traditionally, testing for COVID-19 is done by detecting SARS-CoV-2 in samples collected from nasal swabs and/or saliva. However, SARS-CoV-2 can also be detected in feces of infected individuals. Therefore, wastewater samples can be used to test all individuals of a community contributing to the sewage collection system, i.e., the infrastructure, such as gravity pipes, manholes, tanks, lift stations, control structures, and force mains, that collects used water from residential and commercial sources and conveys the flow to a wastewater treatment plant. Here, we profile community wastewater collected from a manhole, detect presence of SARS-CoV-2, identify genetic mutations of SARS-CoV-2, and perform COVID-19 risk score assessment of the study area. Using metagenomics analysis, we also detect other microorganisms (bacteria, fungi, protists, and viruses) present in the samples. Results show that by analyzing all microorganisms present in wastewater, pathogens circulating in a community can provide an early warning for contagious diseases.",water,,

The activities of antibiotic resistance gene (ARG)-host pathogens pose a threat to public health, and it has been estimated that the infection will lead up to 10 million deaths globally by the year 2050. Hence, in this study, we aim to analyze the efficiency of our municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) process in producing pathogen-free water by investigating the microbial composition between influent and effluent water sites. Shotgun metagenomics sequencing using the Illumina platform was performed on the influent and effluent samples of six different WWTP sites located in Johore, Malaysia. After raw data pre-processing, the non-redundant contigs library was then aligned against BLASTP for taxonomy profiling and the Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database for ARG annotation. Interestingly, the alpha-diversity result reported that effluent site samples showed higher abundance and diverse heterogeneity compared to the influent site. The principal component analysis (PCA) and non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) plots also suggested that effluent sites showed high variation in the genetic material due to loosely clustered sample plots, as compared to the tightly clustered influent samples. This study has successfully identified the top three abundant phyla in influent-Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Bacteroidetes-and effluent-Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Bacteroidetes-water. Despite the overlap within the top three abundant phyla in influent and effluent sites (Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes), the ARG composition heat map and drug class phenotype plot bar exhibits a general trend of a downward shift, showing the efficiency of WWTP in reducing opportunistic pathogens. Overall, it was demonstrated that our municipal WWTP efficiently eliminated pathogenic microbes from the influent water before its total discharge to the environment, though not with the total elimination of microorganisms. This metagenomics study allowed for an examination of our water source and showed the potential interaction of species and ARGs residing in the influent and effluent environment. Both microbial profile structure and co-occurrence network analysis provide integrated understanding regarding the diversity of microorganisms and interactions for future advanced water sanitation treatments.",water,,

Due to cyclical weather cycles, drought, and climate change, water stress has increased worldwide including in Southern California, which serves as a model for regions that integrate reuse of wastewater for both potable and non-potable use. The Orange County Water District (OCWD) Advanced Water Purification Facility (AWPF) is a highly engineered system designed to treat and produce up to 100 million gallons per day (MGD) of purified water from a municipal wastewater source for potable reuse. Routine facility microbial water quality analysis is limited to standard indicators at this and similar facilities. Given recent advances in high throughput DNA sequencing techniques, complete microbial profiling of communities in water samples is now possible. By using 16S/18S rRNA gene sequencing, metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequencing coupled to a highly accurate identification method along with 16S rRNA gene qPCR, we describe a detailed view of the total microbial community throughout the facility. The total bacterial load of the water at stages of the treatment train ranged from 3.02 × 106 copies in source, unchlorinated wastewater feed to 5.49 × 101 copies of 16S rRNA gene/mL after treatment (consisting of microfiltration, reverse osmosis, and ultraviolet/advanced oxidation). Microbial diversity and load decreased by several orders of magnitude after microfiltration and reverse osmosis treatment, falling to almost non-detectable levels that more closely resembled controls of molecular grade laboratory water than the biomass detected in the source water.

Here, a metagenomics method was used to characterize the sewage phageome and identifies the antibiotic resistome. The results showed that the phage families of Siphoviridae, Myoviridae, and Podoviridae were always the most dominant. Analysis of ARGs carried by bacterial and phages showed that MLS and tetracycline resistance genes always had the highest abundances and the other ARG types also have a fixed hierarchy, showing that there is no significant change in overall ARGs abundance distribution. However, an extensively cored antibiotic resistome were specifically identified in aerobic environment. ARGs encoding ribosomal protection proteins, especially for the ARG subtypes lsaE, tet44, tetM, tetP, macB, MdlB and rpoB2, were more inclined to be selected by phages, suggesting that a more refined mechanism, such as specialized transduction and lateral transduction, was probably involved. In all, these results suggest that monitoring of dynamic changes of phage contribution to resistance should be given more attention and ARGs-carrying phage management should focus on using technologies for controlling cored ARGs rather than only the overall distribution of ARGs in phages.",water,,

However, changes to the microbial community throughout treatment, storage, and distribution of this water have not been well characterized. We applied high-throughput amplicon sequencing, read-based, assembly-based, and genome-resolved metagenomics, and flow cytometry to investigate the microbial communities present in a pilot-scale advanced water treatment facility. Advanced treatment of secondary-treated wastewater consisted of ozonation, chloramination, microfiltration, reverse osmosis (RO), advanced oxidation (UV/H2O2), granular activated carbon (GAC) filtration, and chlorination. Treated water was fed into bench-scale simulated distribution systems (SDS). Cell counts and microbial diversity in bulk water decreased until GAC filtration, and the bacterial communities were significantly different following each treatment step. Bacteria grew within GAC media and contributed to a consistent microbial community in the filtrate, which included members of the Rhizobiales and Mycobacteriaceae. After chlorination, some of the GAC filtrate community was maintained within the SDS, and community shifts were associated with stagnation. Putative antibiotic resistance genes and potential opportunistic pathogens were identified before RO and after advanced oxidation, although few if any members of the wastewater microbial community passed through these treatment steps. These findings can contribute to improved design of advanced treatment trains and management of microbial communities in post-treatment steps.",water,,

Hence, freshwater bodies and natural ecosystems around the city are heavily polluted with organic and inorganic contaminants. Yet, there is a paucity of data on pathogenic microorganisms, which potentially threatens health of local communities. We performed a qualitative microbial analysis using a whole metagenome sequencing approach encompassing over 150 gigabases of sequencing data to characterize the Nakivubo wastewater system, which includes a wastewater channel and surrounding wetlands. We found that microbial diversity is heterogeneous throughout the system and that three community state types could be differentiated. We showed the presence of various waterborne agents of gastrointestinal infections in humans, which were associated with leakage occurring around two locations along the wastewater channel.

Our research aimed to characterize the genes and organisms from two different WWTPs that discharge into Lake Michigan, as well as from surrounding lake sediments to determine the dispersal and fate of these factors with respect to distance from the effluent outfall. Shotgun metagenomics coupled to distance-decay analyses showed a higher abundance of genes identical to those in WWTP effluent genes in sediments closer to outfall sites than in sediments farther away, indicating their possible WWTP origin. We also found genes attributed to organisms, such as those belonging to Helicobacteraceae, Legionellaceae, Moraxellaceae, and Neisseriaceae, in effluent from both WWTPs and decreasing in abundance in lake sediments with increased distance from WWTPs. Moreover, our results showed that the WWTPs likely influence the ARG composition in lake sediments close to the effluent discharge. Many of these ARGs were located on MGEs in both the effluent and sediment samples, indicating a relatively broad propensity for horizontal gene transfer (HGT). Our approach allowed us to specifically link genes to organisms and their genetic context, providing insight into WWTP impacts on natural microbial communities. Overall, our results suggest a substantial influence of wastewater effluent on gene content and microbial community structure in the sediments of receiving water bodies.IMPORTANCE Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) release their effluent into aquatic environments. Although treated, effluent retains many genes and microorganisms that have the potential to influence the receiving water in ways that are poorly understood. Here, we tracked the genetic footprint, including genes specific to antibiotic resistance and mobile genetic elements and their associated organisms, from WWTPs to lake sediments. Our work is novel in that we used metagenomic data sets to comprehensively evaluate total gene content and the genetic and taxonomic context of specific genes in environmental samples putatively impacted by WWTP inputs. Based on two different WWTPs with different treatment processes, our findings point to an influence of WWTPs on the presence, abundance, and composition of these factors in the environment.",water,,

      During wastewater treatment, the wastewater microbiome facilitates the degradation of organic matter, reduction of nutrients, and removal of gut parasites. While the latter function is essential to minimize public health risks, the range of parasites involved and how they are removed is still poorly understood.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Using shotgun metagenomic (DNA) and metatranscriptomic (RNA) sequencing data from ten wastewater treatment plants in Switzerland, we were able to assess the entire wastewater microbiome, including the often neglected microeukaryotes (protists). In the latter group, we found a surprising richness and relative abundance of active parasites, particularly in the inflow. Using network analysis, we tracked these taxa across the various treatment compartments and linked their removal to trophic interactions.

Freshwater environments such as rivers represent a potential hotspot for ARGs and antibiotic resistant bacteria as they are receiving systems for effluent discharges from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Effluent also contains low levels of different antimicrobials including antibiotics and biocides. Sulfonamides are antibacterial chemicals widely used in clinical, veterinary and agricultural settings and are frequently detected in sewage sludge and manure in addition to riverine ecosystems. The impact of such exposure on ARG prevalence and diversity is unknown, so the aim of this study was to investigate the release of a sub-lethal concentration of the sulfonamide compound sulfamethoxazole (SMX) on the river bacterial microbiome using a flume system. This system was a semi-natural in vitro flume using river water (30 L) and sediment (6 kg) with circulation to mimic river flow. A combination of 'omics' approaches were conducted to study the impact of SMX exposure on the microbiomes within the flumes. Metagenomic analysis showed that the addition of low concentrations of SMX (<4 μg L-1) had a limited effect on the bacterial resistome in the water fraction only, with no impact observed in the sediment. Metaproteomics did not show differences in ARGs expression with SMX exposure in water. Overall, the river bacterial community was resilient to short term exposure to sub-lethal concentrations of SMX which mimics the exposure such communities experience downstream of WWTPs throughout the year.",water,,

Sprout spent irrigation water (SSIW) provides an informative representation of the total microbiome of this primarily aquaponic crop. This study was designed to characterize the function and taxonomy of the most actively transcribed genes in SSIW from Salmonella enterica serovar Cubana-contaminated alfalfa seeds throughout the sprouting process. Genomic DNA and total RNA from SSIW was collected at regular intervals and sequenced using Illumina MiSeq and NextSeq platforms. Nucleic acid data were annotated using four different pipelines. Both metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analyses revealed a diverse and highly dynamic SSIW microbiome. A ""core"" SSIW microbiome comprised Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Pantoea, and Cronobacter The impact, however, of Salmonella contamination on alfalfa seeds influenced SSIW microbial community dynamics not only structurally but also functionally. Changes in genes associated with metabolism, genetic information processing, environmental information processing, and cellular processes were abundant and time dependent. At time points of 24 h, 48 h, and 96 h, totals of 541, 723, and 424 S Cubana genes, respectively, were transcribed at either higher or lower levels than at 0 h in SSIW during sprouting. An array of S Cubana genes (107) were induced at all three time points, including genes involved in biofilm formation and modulation, stress responses, and virulence and tolerance to antimicrobials. Taken together, these findings expand our understanding of the effect of Salmonella seed contamination on the sprout crop microbiome and metabolome.IMPORTANCE Interactions of human enteric pathogens like Salmonella with plants and plant microbiomes remain to be elucidated. The rapid development of next-generation sequencing technologies provides powerful tools enabling investigation of such interactions from broader and deeper perspectives.

However, the impacts of wastewater discharge from poultry processing plants on the sediment resistome are relatively unexplored. Furthermore, its relationships with important biogeochemical pathways, such as the N cycle, are virtually unknown. The overall objective of this study was to examine the abundance and diversity of antibiotic resistance and N cycling genes in sediment microbial communities impacted by poultry industry wastewater. We performed a metagenomic investigation of sediments in an impacted and a reference tidal creek. We also quantified the abundance of the clinical class 1 integron-integrase gene (intI1) through qPCR as a secondary marker of anthropogenic contamination. Abundance and diversity of ARGs were substantially higher in the impacted tidal creek, especially near the wastewater discharge. Abundances of ARGs conferring resistance to macrolides, tetracyclines, and streptogramins were also higher in the impacted creek than the reference creek. From the N cycling genes detected in the metagenomes, nrfA, the genetic marker for dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia (DNRA), had the strongest positive relationship with the total abundance of ARGs, which may indicate an increased potential of eutrophication in ARG-impacted ecosystems due to nitrogen retention. This study demonstrates that wastewater discharge from a poultry processing plant can increase the spread of ARGs, which may result in negative impacts on ecosystem health.",water,,

      Monitoring microbial communities especially focused on pathogens in newly developed wastewater treatment systems is recommended for public health. Thus, we investigated the microbial community shift in a pilot-scale microalgal treatment system for piggery wastewater.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Microalgae showed reasonable removal efficiencies for COD and ammonia, resulting in higher transparency of the final effluent. Metagenome and microbial diversity analyses showed that heterotrophic microalgal cultivation barely changed the bacterial community; however, the mixotrophic microalgal cultivation induced a sudden change. In addition, an evaluation of risk groups (RGs) of bacteria showed that raw piggery wastewater included abundant pathogens, and the microalgal treatment of the raw piggery wastewater decreased the RG2 pathogens by 63%. However, co-cultivation of microalgae and the most dominant RG2 pathogen, Oligella, showed no direct effects between them.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Thus, a microbial interaction network was constructed to elucidate algae-bacteria interrelationships, and the decrease in Oligella was indirectly connected with microalgal growth via Brevundimonas, Sphingopyxis, and Stenotrophomonas. In a validation test, 3 among 4 connecting bacterial strains exhibited inhibition zones against Oligella. Therefore, we showed that microalgal wastewater treatment causes a decrease in RG2 bacteria, which is an indirect impact of microalgae associated with bacteria. Video abstract.",water,,

In low-income countries, polluted urban runoff and open sewage channels are major sources of microbes. These microbes join natural microbial communities in aquatic ecosystems already impacted by various chemicals, including antibiotics. These composite microbial communities must adapt to survive in such hostile conditions, sometimes promoting the selection of antibiotic-resistant microbial strains by gene transfer. The low probability of exchanges between planktonic microorganisms within the water column may be significantly improved if their contact was facilitated by particular meeting places. This could be specifically the case within biofilms that develop on the surface of the myriads of floating macroplastics increasingly polluting urban tropical surface waters. Moreover, as uncultivable bacterial strains could be involved, analyses of the microbial communities in their whole have to be performed. This means that new-omic technologies must be routinely implemented in low- and middle-income countries to detect the appearance of resistance genes in microbial ecosystems, especially when considering the new 'plastic context.' We summarize the related current knowledge in this short review paper to anticipate new strategies for monitoring and surveying microbial communities.",water,,

Herein, we describe a comprehensive metagenomics-based approach for global surveillance of antibiotic resistance in sewage that enables assessment of 1) which antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) are shared across regions/communities; 2) which ARGs are discriminatory; and 3) factors associated with overall trends in ARGs, such as antibiotic concentrations. Across an internationally sourced transect of sewage samples collected using a centralized, standardized protocol, ARG relative abundances (16S rRNA gene-normalized) were highest in Hong Kong and India and lowest in Sweden and Switzerland, reflecting national policy, measured antibiotic concentrations, and metal resistance genes. Asian versus European/US resistomes were distinct, with macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin, phenicol, quinolone, and tetracycline versus multidrug resistance ARGs being discriminatory, respectively. Regional trends in measured antibiotic concentrations differed from trends expected from public sales data. This could reflect unaccounted uses, captured only by the WBS approach. If properly benchmarked, antibiotic WBS might complement public sales and consumption statistics in the future.

Indian hospital wastewater (HWW) accumulates ARGs from source hospitals and often merges with urban wastewater, with the potential for environmental and human contamination. Despite its putative clinical importance, there is a lack of high-resolution resistome profiling of Indian hospital wastewater, with most studies either relying on conventional PCR-biased techniques or being limited to one city. In this study, we comprehensively analyzed antibiotic resistomes of wastewater from six Indian hospitals distributed in rural and urban areas of northern India through shotgun metagenomics. Our study revealed the predominance of ARGs against aminoglycoside, macrolide, carbapenem, trimethoprim, and sulfonamide antibiotics in all the samples through both read-based analysis and assembly-based analysis. We detected the mobile colistin resistance gene mcr-5.1 for the first time in Indian hospital sewage. blaNDM-1 was present in 4 out of 6 samples and was carried by Pseudomonas aeruginosa in HWW-2, Klebsiella pneumoniae in HWW-4 and HWW-6, and Acinetobacter baumanii in HWW-5. Most ARGs were plasmid-mediated and hosted by Proteobacteria. We identified virulence factors and transposable elements flanking the ARGs, highlighting the role of horizontal gene transmission of ARGs. IMPORTANCE There is a paucity of research on detailed antibiotic resistome and microbiome diversity of Indian hospital wastewater. This study reports the predominance of clinically concerning ARGs such as the beta-lactamases blaNDM and blaOXA and the colistin resistance gene mcr and their association with the microbiome in six different Indian hospital wastewaters of both urban and rural origin. The abundance of plasmid-mediated ARGs and virulence factors calls for urgent AMR crisis management. The lack of proper wastewater management strategies meeting international standards and open drainage systems further complicates the problem of containing the ARGs at these hospitals. This metagenomic study presents the current AMR profile propagating in hospital settings in India and can be used as a reference for future surveillance and risk management of ARGs in Indian hospitals.",water,,

A MinION platform offers low-cost, precise environmental metagenomics analysis. 37 groups of antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB), 11 resistance types with 26 resistance mechanisms - antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) giving tolerance to the aminoglycoside, beta-lactams, fosmidomycin, MLS, multidrug and vancomycin were identified using ARGpore pipeline. The majority of the identified bacteria species were related to the natural environment such as soil and were not dangerous to human. Alarmingly, human pathogenic bacteria carrying resistance to antibiotics currently used against them (Bordetella resistant to macrolides and multidrug resistant Propionibacterium avidum) were also found in the samples. Most abundant viruses identified belonged to Caudovirales and Herpesvirales and they were not carrying ARGs. Unlike the virome, resistome and ARB were not unique for stormwater sampling points.

Although its effects have been well elucidated in the feminization of male fish and interference with the endocrine systems in humans, it has not been fully explored in the activated sludge (AS) microbiome, particularly EE2 (17α-ethynylestradiol). Therefore, in this study, the bacterial community shift in a 6-day laboratory-scale reactor in environmental (0, 5, 10, and 100 ng/L) and predictive elevated concentrations (5, 10, and 100 mg/L) of EE2 was investigated using culture-based and metagenomics approaches. Results showed significant changes (t-test, all p < 0.05) between initial and final physicochemical parameters (pH, DO, and EC). Although environmental concentrations showed a slight decrease in microbial counts (5.6 × 106 to 4.6 × 106 CFU/ml) after a 24-h incubation for the culturable approach, the predictive elevated concentrations (5 to 100 mg/L) revealed a drastic microbial counts reduction (5.6 × 106 to 8 × 102 CFU/ml). The metagenomic data analysis uncovered that bacterial communities in the control sample were dominated by Proteobacteria, followed by Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes. The taxonomic classification after exposure of microbial communities in various concentrations revealed significant differences in community composition between environmental concentration (Shannon indices between 2.58 to 3.68) and predictive elevated concentrations (Shannon indices between 2.24 and 2.84; t-test, all p < 0.05). The EE2 enriched seven OTUs were Novosphingobium, Cloacibacterium, Stenotrophomonas, Enterobacteriaceae_unclassified, Stenotrophomonas, Enterobacteriaceae_unclassified and Rhodobacteraceae_unclassified. These results were supported by a dehydrogenase activity (DHA) test, which demonstrated less (about 40%) DHA in predictive elevated concentrations than in environmental concentrations.

Mobile genetic elements (MGEs) promote the mobilization and dissemination of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) and are thereby critical mediators of AMR within the BWWTP microbial community. At present, it is unclear whether specific AMR categories are differentially disseminated via bacteriophages (phages) or plasmids. To understand the segregation of AMR in relation to MGEs, we analyzed meta-omic (metagenomic, metatranscriptomic and metaproteomic) data systematically collected over 1.5 years from a BWWTP. Our results showed a core group of 15 AMR categories which were found across all timepoints. Some of these AMR categories were disseminated exclusively (bacitracin) or primarily (aminoglycoside, MLS and sulfonamide) via plasmids or phages (fosfomycin and peptide), whereas others were disseminated equally by both. Combined and timepoint-specific analyses of gene, transcript and protein abundances further demonstrated that aminoglycoside, bacitracin and sulfonamide resistance genes were expressed more by plasmids, in contrast to fosfomycin and peptide AMR expression by phages, thereby validating our genomic findings. In the analyzed communities, the dominant taxon Candidatus Microthrix parvicella was a major contributor to several AMR categories whereby its plasmids primarily mediated aminoglycoside resistance. Importantly, we also found AMR associated with ESKAPEE pathogens within the BWWTP, and here MGEs also contributed differentially to the dissemination of the corresponding ARGs. Collectively our findings pave the way toward understanding the segmentation of AMR within MGEs, thereby shedding new light on resistome populations and their mediators, essential elements that are of immediate relevance to human health.",water,,

      Plants live with diverse microbial communities which profoundly affect multiple facets of host performance, but if and how host development impacts the assembly, functions and microbial interactions of crop microbiomes are poorly understood. Here we examined both bacterial and fungal communities across soils, epiphytic and endophytic niches of leaf and root, and plastic leaf of fake plant (representing environment-originating microbes) at three developmental stages of maize at two contrasting sites, and further explored the potential function of phylloplane microbiomes based on metagenomics.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Our results suggested that plant developmental stage had a much stronger influence on the microbial diversity, composition and interkingdom networks in plant compartments than in soils, with the strongest effect in the phylloplane. Phylloplane microbiomes were co-shaped by both plant growth and seasonal environmental factors, with the air (represented by fake plants) as its important source. Further, we found that bacterial communities in plant compartments were more strongly driven by deterministic processes at the early stage but a similar pattern was for fungal communities at the late stage. Moreover, bacterial taxa played a more important role in microbial interkingdom network and crop yield prediction at the early stage, while fungal taxa did so at the late stage. Metagenomic analyses further indicated that phylloplane microbiomes possessed higher functional diversity at the early stage than the late stage, with functional genes related to nutrient provision enriched at the early stage and N assimilation and C degradation enriched at the late stage. Coincidently, more abundant beneficial bacterial taxa like Actinobacteria, Burkholderiaceae and Rhizobiaceae in plant microbiomes were observed at the early stage, but more saprophytic fungi at the late stage.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Our results suggest that host developmental stage profoundly influences plant microbiome assembly and functions, and the bacterial and fungal microbiomes take a differentiated ecological role at different stages of plant development. This study provides empirical evidence for host exerting strong effect on plant microbiomes by deterministic selection during plant growth and development.

In this study, we extracted, sequenced, and characterized the dsDNA and ssDNA viral community from a phyllosphere for the first time. We sampled leaves from winter wheat (Triticum aestivum), where we identified a total of 876 virus operational taxonomic units (vOTUs), mostly predicted to be bacteriophages with a lytic lifestyle. Remarkably, 848 of these vOTUs corresponded to new viral species, and we estimated a minimum of 2.0 × 106 viral particles per leaf.

Pusa Basmati-1) and non-aromatic (cv. BPT-5204) rice-genotypes grown in the mountain and plateau-zones of India by both metagenomic NGS (mNGS) and conventional microbiological methods. Microbiome analysis by sequencing V3-V4 region of ribosomal gene revealed marginally more bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTU) in the mountain zone at Palampur and Almora than plateau zone at Hazaribagh. Interestingly, the rice leaf endophytic microbiomes in mountain zone were found clustered separately from that of plateau-zone. The Bray-Curtis dissimilarity indices indicated influence of geographical location as compared to genotype per se for shaping rice endophytic microbiome composition. Bacterial phyla, Proteobacteria followed by Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Actinobacteria were found abundant in all three locations. The core-microbiome analysis devulged association of Acidovorax; Acinetobacter; Allorhizobium-Neorhizobium-Pararhizobium-Rhizobium; Aureimonas; Bradyrhizobium; Burkholderia-Caballeronia-Paraburkholderia; Enterobacter; Pantoea; Pseudomonas; Sphingomonas; and Stenotrophomonas with the leaf endosphere. The phyllosphere and spermosphere microbiota appears to have contributed to endophytic microbiota of rice leaf. SparCC network analysis of the endophytic-microbiome showed complex cooperative and competitive intra-microbial interactions among the microbial communities. Microbiological validation of mNGS data further confirmed the presence of core and transient genera such as Acidovorax, Alcaligenes, Bacillus, Chryseobacterium, Comamonas, Curtobacterium, Delftia, Microbacterium, Ochrobactrum, Pantoea, Pseudomonas, Rhizobium, Rhodococcus, Sphingobacterium, Staphylococcus, Stenotrophomonas, and Xanthomonas in the rice genotypes.

      Understanding the genetic and environmental factors that structure plant microbiomes is necessary for leveraging these interactions to address critical needs in agriculture, conservation, and sustainability. Legumes, which form root nodule symbioses with nitrogen-fixing rhizobia, have served as model plants for understanding the genetics and evolution of beneficial plant-microbe interactions for decades, and thus have added value as models of plant-microbiome interactions. Here we use a common garden experiment with 16S rRNA gene amplicon and shotgun metagenomic sequencing to study the drivers of microbiome diversity and composition in three genotypes of the model legume Medicago truncatula grown in two native soil communities.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Bacterial diversity decreased between external (rhizosphere) and internal plant compartments (root endosphere, nodule endosphere, and leaf endosphere). Community composition was shaped by strong compartment × soil origin and compartment × plant genotype interactions, driven by significant soil origin effects in the rhizosphere and significant plant genotype effects in the root endosphere. Nevertheless, all compartments were dominated by Ensifer, the genus of rhizobia that forms root nodule symbiosis with M. truncatula, and additional shotgun metagenomic sequencing suggests that the nodulating Ensifer were not genetically distinguishable from those elsewhere in the plant. We also identify a handful of OTUs that are common in nodule tissues, which are likely colonized from the root endosphere.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Our results demonstrate strong host filtering effects, with rhizospheres driven by soil origin and internal plant compartments driven by host genetics, and identify several key nodule-inhabiting taxa that coexist with rhizobia in the native range. Our results set the stage for future functional genetic experiments aimed at expanding our pairwise understanding of legume-rhizobium symbiosis toward a more mechanistic understanding of plant microbiomes.

Endophytic bacterial diversity was analyzed in this study to describe 16S rRNA variability and changes in the leaves of drought-tolerant and drought-susceptible wheat when growth under in vitro conditions. A metagenomic analysis was applied and a pilot exploratory study was performed to prove this type of analysis as applicable to tracking endophytic bacterial diversity changes when a drought stress is applied to an in vitro culture of wheat.

Although there have been extensive studies conducted on these known wheat viruses, currently, there is limited knowledge about all components of the wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) virome. Here, we determined the composition of the wheat virome through total RNA deep sequencing of field-collected leaf samples. Sequences were de novo assembled after removing the host reads, and BLASTx searches were conducted. In addition to the documented wheat viruses, novel plant and fungal-associated viral sequences were identified. We obtained the full genome sequence of the first umbra-like associated RNA virus tentatively named wheat umbra-like virus in cereals. Moreover, a novel bi-segmented putative virus tentatively named wheat-associated vipovirus sharing low but significant similarity with both plant and fungal-associated viruses was identified. Additionally, a new putative fungal-associated tobamo-like virus and novel putative Mitovirus were discovered in wheat samples. The discovery and characterization of novel viral sequences associated with wheat is important to determine if these putative viruses may pose a threat to the wheat industry or have the potential to be used as new biological control agents for wheat pathogens either as wild-type or recombinant viruses.",plant,,

      Plants can recruit beneficial microbes to enhance their ability to defend against pathogens. However, in contrast to the intensively studied roles of the rhizosphere microbiome in suppressing plant pathogens, the collective community-level change and effect of the phyllosphere microbiome in response to pathogen invasion remains largely elusive.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Here, we integrated 16S metabarcoding, shotgun metagenomics and culture-dependent methods to systematically investigate the changes in phyllosphere microbiome between infected and uninfected citrus leaves by Diaporthe citri, a fungal pathogen causing melanose disease worldwide. Multiple microbiome features suggested a shift in phyllosphere microbiome upon D. citri infection, highlighted by the marked reduction of community evenness, the emergence of large numbers of new microbes, and the intense microbial network. We also identified the microbiome features from functional perspectives in infected leaves, such as enriched microbial functions for iron competition and potential antifungal traits, and enriched microbes with beneficial genomic characteristics. Glasshouse experiments demonstrated that several bacteria associated with the microbiome shift could positively affect plant performance under D. citri challenge, with reductions in disease index ranging from 65.7 to 88.4%. Among them, Pantoea asv90 and Methylobacterium asv41 identified as ""recruited new microbes"" in the infected leaves, exhibited antagonistic activities to D. citri both in vitro and in vivo, including inhibition of spore germination and/or mycelium growth. Sphingomonas spp. presented beneficial genomic characteristics and were found to be the main contributor for the functional enrichment of iron complex outer membrane receptor protein in the infected leaves. Moreover, Sphingomonas asv20 showed a stronger suppression ability against D. citri in iron-deficient conditions than iron-sufficient conditions, suggesting a role of iron competition during their antagonistic action.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Overall, our study revealed how phyllosphere microbiomes differed between infected and uninfected citrus leaves by melanose pathogen, and identified potential mechanisms for how the observed microbiome shift might have helped plants cope with pathogen pressure. Our findings provide novel insights into understanding the roles of phyllosphere microbiome responses during pathogen challenge. Video abstract.",plant,,

Before entering the host tissues, this pathogen has an epiphytic growth phase on kiwifruit flowers and leaves, thus the ecological interactions within epiphytic bacterial community may greatly influence the onset of the infection process. The bacterial community associated to the two most important cultivated kiwifruit species, Actinidia chinensis and Actinidia deliciosa, was described both on flowers and leaves using Illumina massive parallel sequencing of the V3 and V4 variable regions of the 16S rRNA gene. In addition, the effect of plant infection by Psa on the epiphytic bacterial community structure and biodiversity was investigated. Psa infection affected the phyllosphere microbiome structures in both species, however, its impact was more pronounced on A. deliciosa leaves, where a drastic drop in microbial biodiversity was observed. Furthermore, we also showed that Psa was always present in syndemic association with Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae and Pseudomonas viridiflava, two other kiwifruit pathogens, suggesting the establishment of a pathogenic consortium leading to a higher pathogenesis capacity. Finally, the analyses of the dynamics of bacterial populations provided useful information for the screening and selection of potential biocontrol agents against Psa.",plant,,

However, there is limited available information on its application towards securing plant health. Hence, this study adopts the metagenomic approach to unravel the microbiome diversity associated with healthy (LI and MA) and Northern corn leaf blight (NCLB) infected (LID and MAD) maize rhizosphere in the maize growing field at Lichtenburg and Mafikeng, North-West province of South Africa. The extraction of whole DNA from the respective healthy and diseased rhizosphere soils was conducted and sequenced using shotgun metagenomics. A total of 12 bacteria, 4 archaea and 2 fungal phyla were found as predominant across the fields with the use of the SEED subsystem database. The most predominant bacteria phyla included Proteobacteria, Dienococcus-Thermus, Gemmatimonadetes, Chlorobi, Cyanobacteria, Planctomycetes, Verrucomicrobia, Acidobacteria, Firmicutes, Chloroflexi and Bacteroidetes. Archaea consisted of Euryarchaeota, Thaumarchaeota, Crenarchaeota and Korachaeota, while Ascomycota and Basidiomycota were the dominant fungal phyla. Microbial abundance and diversity were higher in the rhizosphere of healthy maize (LI and MA) rhizosphere as compared to the NCLB diseased (LID and MAD), in the order LI > MA > LID > MAD. At phylum and genus level, alpha diversity index showed no significant (p > 0.05) difference in the abundance of the microbial community of healthy and NCLB infected maize rhizosphere, while beta analysis produced a significant (p = 0.01) difference in the microbial diversity in the soil. Taken together, the study revealed that the abundance of microbial diversity in the maize rhizosphere influences the efficacy of the rhizosphere microbiome to modulate microbial functions towards managing and sustaining plant health.",plant,,

These plants are useful models to understand the complex biology of vegetative desiccation tolerance. Despite extensive studies of resurrection plants, many details underlying the mechanisms of desiccation tolerance remain unexplored. To summarize the progress in resurrection plant research and identify unexplored questions, we conducted a systematic review of 15 model angiosperm resurrection plants. This systematic review provides an overview of publication trends on resurrection plants, the geographical distribution of species and studies, and the methodology used. Using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses protocol we surveyed all publications on resurrection plants from 2000 and 2020. This yielded 185 empirical articles that matched our selection criteria. The most investigated plants were Craterostigma plantagineum (17.5%), Haberlea rhodopensis (13.7%), Xerophyta viscosa (reclassified as X. schlechteri) (11.9%), Myrothamnus flabellifolia (8.5%), and Boea hygrometrica (8.1%), with all other species accounting for less than 8% of publications. The majority of studies have been conducted in South Africa, Bulgaria, Germany, and China, but there are contributions from across the globe. Most studies were led by researchers working within the native range of the focal species, but some international and collaborative studies were also identified. The number of annual publications fluctuated, with a large but temporary increase in 2008. Many studies have employed physiological and transcriptomic methodologies to investigate the leaves of resurrection plants, but there was a paucity of studies on roots and only one metagenomic study was recovered. Based on these findings we suggest that future research focuses on resurrection plant roots and microbiome interactions to explore microbial communities associated with these plants, and their role in vegetative desiccation tolerance.",plant,,

Belowground microbial diversity is widely reported as a major factor in determining the composition of the plant microbiome. In contrast, much less is known about the role of the atmosphere in relation to the plant microbiome. The current study examined the hypothesis that the atmospheric microbiome influences the composition of fungal communities of the aboveground organs (flowers, fruit, and leaves) of table grape and vice versa. The atmosphere surrounding grape plantings exhibited a significantly higher level of fungal diversity relative to the nearby plant organs and shared a higher number of phylotypes (5,536 OTUs, 40.3%) with the plant than between organs of the same plant. Using a Bayesian source tracking approach, plant organs were determined to be the major source of the atmospheric fungal community (92%). In contrast, airborne microbiota had only a minor contribution to the grape microbiome, representing the source of 15, 4, and 35% of the fungal communities of leaves, flowers, and fruits, respectively. Moreover, data indicate that plant organs and the surrounding atmosphere shared a fraction of each other's fungal communities, and this shared pool of fungal taxa serves as a two-way reservoir of microorganisms. Microbial association analysis highlighted more positive than negative interactions between fungal phylotypes. Positive interactions were more common within the same environment, while negative interactions appeared to occur more frequently between different environments, i.e., atmosphere, leaf, flower, and fruit. The current study revealed the interplay between the fungal communities of the grape phyllosphere with the surrounding air. Plants were identified as a major source of recruitment for the atmospheric microbiome, while the surrounding atmosphere contributed only a small fraction of the plant fungal community. The results of the study suggested that the plant-air interface modulates the plant recruitment of atmospheric fungi, taking a step forward in understanding the plant holobiont assembly and how the atmosphere surrounding plants plays a role in this process. The impact of plants on the atmospheric microbiota has several biological and epidemiological implications for plants and humans.",plant,,

However, the structure and functions of microbiome have not been clarified during the tobacco aging process. In this study, 16S rDNA and ITS amplicon sequencing techniques were used to analyze the core microbiome of 15 tobacco samples from five different aging stages. The whole bacterial microbiome was classified into 29 microbial phyla and 132 orders. Enterobacteriales (63%), Pseudomonadales (16%), Sphingomonadales (8%), Xanthomonadales (4%), Burkholderiales (4%), Rhizobiales (3%), and Bacillales (2%) comprised the core bacterial microbiome. The whole fungal microbiome was classified into five microbial phyla and 52 orders.

FAPROTAX function prediction suggested that the core microbiome has a substantial potential for the carbon cycle, nitrate metabolism, aromatic compound degradation, chitinolysis, cellulolysis, and xylanolysis, but simultaneously, the core microbiome is also a source of human pathogens. The dynamics of the bacterial community were primarily determined by the total nitrogen in tobacco leaves during the aging process, while those of the fungal microbiome were primarily determined by total organic carbon. This study indicated that the core microbiome activities may play an important role in regulating the loss of carbon organic compounds and enhancing the secondary metabolites during tobacco leaves aging process.",plant,,

To assess possible co-effects on the composition of the phyllosphere microbiome, concentrations of particulate matter and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were determined from sampled leaves. We found that environmental factors had a significative influence on the phyllosphere biodiversity, altering the taxa relative abundances. Ascomycota and Firmicutes were higher in summer and in urban areas, whereas a significant increase in Proteobacteria was observed in the winter season, with higher abundance in natural areas. Network analysis suggested that OTUs belonging to Acidobacteria, Cytophagia, unkn. Firmicutes(p), Actinobacteria are keystone of the Q. ilex phyllosphere microbiome.

Here we show that the short-term consumption of diets composed entirely of animal or plant products alters microbial community structure and overwhelms inter-individual differences in microbial gene expression. The animal-based diet increased the abundance of bile-tolerant microorganisms (Alistipes, Bilophila and Bacteroides) and decreased the levels of Firmicutes that metabolize dietary plant polysaccharides (Roseburia, Eubacterium rectale and Ruminococcus bromii). Microbial activity mirrored differences between herbivorous and carnivorous mammals, reflecting trade-offs between carbohydrate and protein fermentation. Foodborne microbes from both diets transiently colonized the gut, including bacteria, fungi and even viruses. Finally, increases in the abundance and activity of Bilophila wadsworthia on the animal-based diet support a link between dietary fat, bile acids and the outgrowth of microorganisms capable of triggering inflammatory bowel disease.

      This study aimed to explore the effects of an isocaloric Mediterranean diet (MD) intervention on metabolic health, gut microbiome and systemic metabolome in subjects with lifestyle risk factors for metabolic disease.
    


          Design:
        
      
      Eighty-two healthy overweight and obese subjects with a habitually low intake of fruit and vegetables and a sedentary lifestyle participated in a parallel 8-week randomised controlled trial. Forty-three participants consumed an MD tailored to their habitual energy intakes (MedD), and 39 maintained their regular diets (ConD). Dietary adherence, metabolic parameters, gut microbiome and systemic metabolome were monitored over the study period.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Increased MD adherence in the MedD group successfully reprogrammed subjects' intake of fibre and animal proteins. Compliance was confirmed by lowered levels of carnitine in plasma and urine. Significant reductions in plasma cholesterol (primary outcome) and faecal bile acids occurred in the MedD compared with the ConD group. Shotgun metagenomics showed gut microbiome changes that reflected individual MD adherence and increase in gene richness in participants who reduced systemic inflammation over the intervention. The MD intervention led to increased levels of the fibre-degrading Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and of genes for microbial carbohydrate degradation linked to butyrate metabolism. The dietary changes in the MedD group led to increased urinary urolithins, faecal bile acid degradation and insulin sensitivity that co-varied with specific microbial taxa.
    


          Conclusion:

Viral infections5 and broader gut dysbioses6 have been identified as potential causes or contributing factors; however, human studies have not yet identified microbial compositional or functional triggers that are predictive of islet autoimmunity or T1D. Here we analyse 10,913 metagenomes in stool samples from 783 mostly white, non-Hispanic children. The samples were collected monthly from three months of age until the clinical end point (islet autoimmunity or T1D) in the The Environmental Determinants of Diabetes in the Young (TEDDY) study, to characterize the natural history of the early gut microbiome in connection to islet autoimmunity, T1D diagnosis, and other common early life events such as antibiotic treatments and probiotics. The microbiomes of control children contained more genes that were related to fermentation and the biosynthesis of short-chain fatty acids, but these were not consistently associated with particular taxa across geographically diverse clinical centres, suggesting that microbial factors associated with T1D are taxonomically diffuse but functionally more coherent. When we investigated the broader establishment and development of the infant microbiome, both taxonomic and functional profiles were dynamic and highly individualized, and dominated in the first year of life by one of three largely exclusive Bifidobacterium species (B. bifidum, B. breve or B. longum) or by the phylum Proteobacteria.

Members of the genus Lactobacillus, although best understood for essential roles in food fermentations and applications as probiotics, have also come to the fore in a number of untargeted gut microbiome studies in humans and animals. Even though Lactobacillus is only a minor member of the human colonic microbiota, the proportions of those bacteria are frequently either positively or negatively correlated with human disease and chronic conditions.

Microbial genes are essential for key metabolic processes, such as the breakdown of indigestible dietary fibres to short-chain fatty acids, biosynthesis of amino acids and vitamins, and production of neurotransmitters and hormones. During the last decade, evidence has accumulated to support a role for gut microbiota (analysed from faecal samples) in glycaemic control and type 2 diabetes. Mechanistic studies in mice support a causal role for gut microbiota in metabolic diseases, although human data favouring causality is insufficient. As it may be challenging to sort the human evidence from the large number of animal studies in the field, there is a need to provide a review of human studies. Thus, the aim of this review is to cover the current and future possibilities and challenges of using the gut microbiota, with its capacity to be modified, in the development of preventive and treatment strategies for hyperglycaemia and type 2 diabetes in humans. We discuss what is known about the composition and functionality of human gut microbiota in type 2 diabetes and summarise recent evidence of current treatment strategies that involve, or are based on, modification of gut microbiota (diet, probiotics, metformin and bariatric surgery). We go on to review some potential future gut-based glucose-lowering approaches involving microbiota, including the development of personalised nutrition and probiotic approaches, identification of therapeutic components of probiotics, targeted delivery of propionate in the proximal colon, targeted delivery of metformin in the lower gut, faecal microbiota transplantation, and the incorporation of genetically modified bacteria that express therapeutic factors into microbiota. Finally, future avenues and challenges for understanding the interplay between human nutrition, genetics and microbial genetics, and the need for integration of human multi-omic data (such as genetics, transcriptomics, epigenetics, proteomics and metabolomics) with microbiome data (such as strain-level variation, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics) to make personalised treatments a successful future reality are discussed.",animal,,

To evaluate the role of BAs in intestinal inflammation, we performed metabolomic, microbiome, metagenomic, and transcriptomic profiling of stool from ileal pouches (surgically created resevoirs) in colectomy-treated patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) versus controls (familial adenomatous polyposis [FAP]). We show that relative to FAP, UC pouches have reduced levels of lithocholic acid and deoxycholic acid (normally the most abundant gut SBAs), genes required to convert PBAs to SBAs, and Ruminococcaceae (one of few taxa known to include SBA-producing bacteria). In three murine colitis models, SBA supplementation reduces intestinal inflammation. This anti-inflammatory effect is in part dependent on the TGR5 bile acid receptor. These data suggest that dysbiosis induces SBA deficiency in inflammatory-prone UC patients, which promotes a pro-inflammatory state within the intestine that may be treated by SBA restoration.",animal,,

Gut microbes signal via metabolites, but how the metabolites impact CRC is largely unknown. We interrogated fecal metabolites associated with mouse models of colon tumorigenesis with varying mutational load. We find that microbial metabolites from healthy mice or humans are growth-repressive, and this response is attenuated in mice and patients with CRC. Microbial profiling reveals that Lactobacillus reuteri and its metabolite, reuterin, are downregulated in mouse and human CRC. Reuterin alters redox balance, and reduces proliferation and survival in colon cancer cells. Reuterin induces selective protein oxidation and inhibits ribosomal biogenesis and protein translation. Exogenous Lactobacillus reuteri restricts colon tumor growth, increases tumor reactive oxygen species, and decreases protein translation in vivo. Our findings indicate that a healthy microbiome and specifically, Lactobacillus reuteri, is protective against CRC through microbial metabolite exchange.",animal,,

      The microbiome directly affects the balance of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory responses in the gut. As microbes thrive on dietary substrates, the question arises whether we can nourish an anti-inflammatory gut ecosystem. We aim to unravel interactions between diet, gut microbiota and their functional ability to induce intestinal inflammation.
    


          Design:
        
      
      We investigated the relation between 173 dietary factors and the microbiome of 1425 individuals spanning four cohorts: Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, irritable bowel syndrome and the general population. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing was performed to profile gut microbial composition and function. Dietary intake was assessed through food frequency questionnaires. We performed unsupervised clustering to identify dietary patterns and microbial clusters. Associations between diet and microbial features were explored per cohort, followed by a meta-analysis and heterogeneity estimation.
    


          Results:
        
      
      We identified 38 associations between dietary patterns and microbial clusters. Moreover, 61 individual foods and nutrients were associated with 61 species and 249 metabolic pathways in the meta-analysis across healthy individuals and patients with IBS, Crohn's disease and UC (false discovery rate<0.05). Processed foods and animal-derived foods were consistently associated with higher abundances of Firmicutes, Ruminococcus species of the Blautia genus and endotoxin synthesis pathways. The opposite was found for plant foods and fish, which were positively associated with short-chain fatty acid-producing commensals and pathways of nutrient metabolism.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      We identified dietary patterns that consistently correlate with groups of bacteria with shared functional roles in both, health and disease. Moreover, specific foods and nutrients were associated with species known to infer mucosal protection and anti-inflammatory effects. We propose microbial mechanisms through which the diet affects inflammatory responses in the gut as a rationale for future intervention studies.",animal,,

We demonstrate GI barrier defects and microbiota alterations in the maternal immune activation (MIA) mouse model that is known to display features of ASD. Oral treatment of MIA offspring with the human commensal Bacteroides fragilis corrects gut permeability, alters microbial composition, and ameliorates defects in communicative, stereotypic, anxiety-like and sensorimotor behaviors. MIA offspring display an altered serum metabolomic profile, and B. fragilis modulates levels of several metabolites. Treating naive mice with a metabolite that is increased by MIA and restored by B. fragilis causes certain behavioral abnormalities, suggesting that gut bacterial effects on the host metabolome impact behavior. Taken together, these findings support a gut-microbiome-brain connection in a mouse model of ASD and identify a potential probiotic therapy for GI and particular behavioral symptoms in human neurodevelopmental disorders.",animal,,

This dysbiosis plays an important role in clinical manifestations, particularly in the lungs, affected by chronic infection. The range of microbiological tools has recently been enriched by metagenomics based on next-generation sequencing (NGS). Currently applied essentially in a gene-targeted manner, metagenomics has enabled very exhaustive description of bacterial communities in the CF lung niche and, to a lesser extent, the fungi. Aided by progress in bioinformatics, this now makes it possible to envisage shotgun sequencing and opens the door to other areas of the microbial world, the virome, and the archaeome, for which almost everything remains to be described in cystic fibrosis. Paradoxically, applying NGS in microbiology has seen a rebirth of bacterial culture, but in an extended manner (culturomics), which has proved to be a perfectly complementary approach to NGS. Animal models have also proved indispensable for validating microbiome pathophysiological hypotheses. Description of pathological microbiomes and correlation with clinical status and therapeutics (antibiotic therapy, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulators) revealed the richness of microbiome data, enabling description of predictive and follow-up biomarkers.

Both rodent and human studies regarding gut microbiota in SS and environmental dry eye are explored, and the effects of prebiotics and probiotics on dry eye are discussed.

Microbial pathogens drive tumorigenesis in 15% to 20% of cancer cases. Even larger numbers of malignancies are associated with an altered composition of commensal microbiota (dysbiosis) based on microbiome studies using metagenomic sequencing. Although association studies cannot distinguish whether changes in microbiota are causes or effects of cancer, a causative role is supported by rigorously controlled preclinical studies using gnotobiotic mouse models colonized with one or more specific bacteria. These studies demonstrate that microbiota can alter cancer susceptibility and progression by diverse mechanisms, such as modulating inflammation, inducing DNA damage, and producing metabolites involved in oncogenesis or tumor suppression. Evidence is emerging that microbiota can be manipulated for improving cancer treatment. By incorporating probiotics as adjuvants for checkpoint immunotherapy or by designing small molecules that target microbial enzymes, microbiota can be harnessed to improve cancer care.

Climate change and land use practices are expected to affect biogeochemical cycling by the soil microbiome in these ecosystems. Understanding how soil microbial community might respond to these drivers is extremely important to mitigate the processes of land degradation and desertification. The Caatinga, an exclusively Brazilian biome composed of an extensive seasonal tropical dry forest, is exposed to variable spatiotemporal rainfall patterns as well as strong human-driven pressures. Herein, an integrated analysis of shotgun metagenomics approach coupled to meteorological data was employed to unravel the impact of seasonality and land use change on soil microbiome from preserved and agriculture-affected experimental fields in Caatinga drylands. Multivariate analysis suggested that microbial communities of preserved soils under seasonal changes were shaped primarily by water deficit, with a strong increase of Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria members in the dry and rainy seasons, respectively. In contrast, nutrient availability notably played a critical role in driving the microbial community in agriculture-affected soils. The strong enrichment of bacterial genera belonging to the poorly-known phylum Acidobacteria ('Candidatus Solibacter' and 'Candidatus Koribacter') in soils from dry season affected by ferti-irrigation practices presupposes a contrasting copiotrophic lifestyle and ecological role in mitigating the impact of chemical fertilization. Functional analyses identify overrepresented genes related to osmotic stress response (synthesis of osmoprotectant compounds, accumulation of potassium ions) and preferential carbon and nitrogen utilization when comparing the microbiome of preserved soils under seasonal changes, reflecting differences in the genetic potential for nutrient cycling and C acquisition in the environment. However, the prevalence of nitrosative stress and denitrification functions in irrigation/fertilization-affected soils of the dry season clearly suggest that nutrient input and disruption of natural water regime may impact biogeochemical cycles linked to the microbial processes, with potential impacts on the ecosystem functionality. These findings help to better understand how natural seasonality and agricultural management differentially affect soil microbial ecology from dry forests, providing support for the development of more sustainable land management in dryland ecosystems.",soil,,

      Hospital sewage have been associated with incorporation of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) into microbes, which is considered as a key indicator for the spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). The compositions of dental waste water (DWW) contain heavy metals, the evolution of AMR and its effects on the water environment in the context of heavy metal environment have not been seriously investigated. Thus, our major aims were to elucidate the evolution of AMR in DWW.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      DWW samples were collected from a major dental department. The presence of microbial communities, ARGs, and MGEs in untreated and treated (by filter membrane and ozone) samples were analyzed using metagenomics and bioinformatic methods.
    


          Results:
        
      
      DWW-associated resistomes included 1,208 types of ARGs, belonging to 29 antibiotic types/subtypes. The most abundant types/subtypes were ARGs of multidrug resistance and of antibiotics that were frequently used in the clinical practice. Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Chryseobacterium indologenes, Sphingomonas laterariae were the main bacteria which hosted these ARGs. Mobilomes in DWW consisted of 93 MGE subtypes which belonged to 8 MGE types. Transposases were the most frequently detected MGEs which formed networks of communications. For example, ISCrsp1 and tnpA.5/4/11 were the main transposases located in the central hubs of a network. These significant associations between ARGs and MGEs revealed the strong potential of ARGs transmission towards development of antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) bacteria. On the other hand, treatment of DWW using membranes and ozone was only effective in removing minor species of bacteria and types of ARGs and MGEs.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are employed to augment cytotoxic anti-cancer activity by inhibiting negative regulatory elements of the immune system. Modulating the immune system to target neoplasms has improved survivability of numerous cancers in many individuals, but forecasting outcomes post therapy is difficult due to insufficient predictive biomarkers. Recently, the tumor and gastrointestinal microbiome and immune milieu have been investigated as predictors and influencers of cancer immune therapy. In this review, we discuss: (1) ways to measure the microbiome including relevant bioinformatic analyses, (2) recent developments in animal studies and human clinical trials utilizing gut microbial composition and function as biomarkers of cancer immune therapy response and toxicity, and (3) using prebiotics, probiotics, postbiotics, antibiotics, and fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) to modulate immune therapy. We discuss the respective benefits of 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene and shotgun metagenomic sequencing including important considerations in obtaining samples and in designing and interpreting human and animal microbiome studies. We then focus on studies discussing the differences in response to ICIs in relation to the microbiome and inflammatory mediators. ICIs cause colitis in up to 25% of individuals, and colitis is often refractory to common immunosuppressive medications. Researchers have measured microbiota composition prior to ICI therapy and correlated baseline microbiota composition with efficacy and colitis. Certain bacterial taxa that appear to enhance therapeutic benefit are also implicated in increased susceptibility to colitis, alluding to a delicate balance between pro-inflammatory tumor killing and anti-inflammatory protection from colitis. Pre-clinical and clinical models have trialed probiotic administration, e.g. Bifidobacterium spp. or FMT, to treat colitis when immune suppressive agents fail.

A wide variety of microbial communities beneficial to plants and contributing to plant health and production are found in the rhizosphere. The wheat microbiome encompasses an extensive variety of microbial species playing a key role in sustaining the physiology of the crop, nutrient uptake, and biotic/abiotic stress resilience. This report presents wheat microbiome analysis under six different farm practices, namely, organic (Org), timely sown (TS), wheat after pulse crop (WAPC), temperature-controlled phenotyping facility (TCPF), maize-wheat cropping system (MW), and residue burnt field (Bur), using 16S rRNA sequencing methodology. The soil samples collected from either side of the wheat row were mixed to get a final sample set for DNA extraction under each condition. After the data preprocessing, microbial community analysis was performed, followed by functional analysis and annotation. An abundance of the phylum Proteobacteria was observed, followed by Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Gemmatimonadetes in the majority of the samples, while relative abundance was found to vary at the genus level. Analysis against the Carbohydrate-Active Enzymes (CAZy) database showed a high number of glycoside hydrolase genes in the TS, TCPF, and WAPC samples, while the Org, MW, and Bur samples predominantly had glycosyltransferase genes and carbohydrate esterase genes were in the lowest numbers. Also, the Org and TCPF samples showed lower diversity, while rare and abundant species ranged from 12 to 25% and 20 to 32% of the total bacterial species in all the sets, respectively. These variations indicate that the different cropping sequence had a significant impact on soil microbial diversity and community composition, which characterizes its economic and environmental value as a sustainable agricultural approach to maintaining food security and ecosystem health. IMPORTANCE This investigation examined the wheat microbiome under six different agricultural field conditions to understand the role of cropping pattern on soil microbial diversity. This study also elaborated the community composition, which has importance in economic (role of beneficial community leading to higher production) and environmental (role of microbial diversity/community in safeguarding the soil health, etc.) arenas. This could lead to a sustainable farming approach for food security and improved ecosystem health. Also, the majority of the microbes are unculturable; hence, technology-based microcultivation will be a potential approach for harnessing other cultured microorganisms, leading to unique species for commercial production.

We extracted DNA extracted from collected samples and performed high-throughput sequencing of PCR amplicons from both the fungal ITS and prokaryotic 16S rRNA gene regions. Sequences were then grouped into amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) and subjected to network analysis. Based on both ITS and 16S rRNA gene data, a greater network size and edges were observed for all sample types from H-sites compared to L-sites at both SGS. Network analysis suggested that the number of potential microbial interactions/associations were greater in samples from H-sites compared to L-sites. Diversity analyses indicated that site-type was not a main driver of alpha and beta diversity in soybean-associated microbial communities. L-sites contained a greater percentage of fungal phytopathogens (ex: Fusarium, Macrophomina, Septoria), while H-sites contained a greater percentage of mycoparasitic (ex: Trichoderma) and entomopathogenic (ex: Metarhizium) fungal genera. Furthermore, roots from H-sites possessed a greater percentage of Bradyrhizobium and genera known to contain plant growth promoting bacteria (ex: Flavobacterium, Duganella).

By characterizing the bacterial and archaeal community (via 16S rRNA sequencing) associated with bulk and rhizosphere soil of sixteen strawberry cultivars in two controlled field studies, we explored the relationships between the soil microbiome and plant resistance to two soil-borne fungal pathogens (Verticillium dahliae and Macrophomina phaseolina). Overall, the plants had a distinctive and genotype-dependent rhizosphere microbiome with higher abundances of known beneficial bacteria such as Pseudomonads and Rhizobium. The rhizosphere microbiome played a significant role in the resistance to the two soil-borne pathogens as shown by the differences in microbiome between high and low resistance cultivars. Resistant cultivars were characterized by higher abundances of known biocontrol microorganisms including actinobacteria (Arthrobacter, Nocardioides and Gaiella) and unclassified acidobacteria (Gp6, Gp16 and Gp4), in both pathogen trials. Additionally, cultivars that were resistant to V. dahliae had higher rhizosphere abundances of Burkholderia and cultivars resistant to M. phaseolina had higher abundances of Pseudomonas. The mechanisms involved in these beneficial plant-microbial interactions and their plasticity in different environments should be studied further for the design of low-input disease management strategies.",,the rhizosphere microbiome plays a role in the resistance to soil-borne pathogens and nutrient uptake of strawberry cultivars under field conditions,

Little is known about how various biotic and abiotic factors affect the lettuce microbiome, which in turn impacts STEC colonization. We characterized the lettuce phyllosphere and surface soil bacterial, fungal, and oomycete communities at harvest in late-spring and -fall in California using metagenomics. Harvest season and field type, but not cultivar, significantly influenced the microbiome composition of leaves and surface soil near plants. Phyllosphere and soil microbiome compositions were correlated with specific weather factors. The relative abundance of Enterobacteriaceae, but not E. coli, was enriched on leaves (5.2%) compared to soil (0.4%) and correlated positively with minimum air temperature and wind speed. Co-occurrence networks revealed seasonal trends in fungi-bacteria interactions on leaves. These associations represented 39%-44% of the correlations between species. All significant E. coli co-occurrences with fungi were positive, while all negative associations were with bacteria.

Root exudates determine soil nutrient mobilization, plant nutritional status, and the communication of plant roots with microbes. Root exudates contain diverse specialized signaling metabolites (primary and secondary). The spatial behavior of these metabolites around the root zone strongly influences rhizosphere microorganisms through an intimate compatible interaction, thereby regulating complex biological and ecological mechanisms. In this context, we reviewed the current understanding of the biological phenomenon of allelopathy, which is mediated by phytotoxic compounds (called allelochemicals) released by plants into the soil that affect the growth, survival, development, ecological infestation, and intensification of other plant species and microbes in natural communities or agricultural systems. Advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS), such as metagenomics and metatranscriptomics, have opened the possibility of better understanding the effects of secreted metabolites on the composition and activity of root-associated microbial communities. Nevertheless, understanding the role of secretory metabolites in microbiome manipulation can assist in designing next-generation microbial inoculants for targeted disease mitigation and improved plant growth using the synthetic microbial communities (SynComs) tool. Besides a discussion on different approaches, we highlighted the advantages of conjugation of metabolomic approaches with genetic design (metabolite-based genome-wide association studies) in dissecting metabolome diversity and understanding the genetic components of metabolite accumulation. Recent advances in the field of metabolomics have expedited comprehensive and rapid profiling and discovery of novel bioactive compounds in root exudates. In this context, we discussed the expanding array of metabolomics platforms for metabolome profiling and their integration with multivariate data analysis, which is crucial to explore the biosynthesis pathway, as well as the regulation of associated pathways at the gene, transcript, and protein levels, and finally their role in determining and shaping the rhizomicrobiome.",,tapping into plant-microbiome interactions through the lens of multi-omics techniques,

Soil moisture is a vital factor in soil microbiomes, but its role in the regulation of microbial suppression is poorly understood. Here, we investigated the correlation of root rot disease of Panax notoginseng with rhizosphere microbial communities mediated by soil moisture gradients from 55% to 100% field capacity (FC); then, we captured the disease-suppressive and disease-inductive microbiomes and validated their functions by a culture experiment with synthetic microbiotas containing keystone species. We found that proper soil moisture at 75% to 95% FC could maintain a disease-suppressive microbiome to alleviate root rot disease. However, extremely low or high soil moistures (>95% FC or <75% FC) could aggravate root rot disease by depleting the disease-suppressive microbiome while enriching the disease-inductive microbiome. Both the low-soil-moisture-enriched pathogen Monographella cucumerina and the high-soil-moisture-enriched pathogen Ilyonectria destructans could synergize with different disease-inductive microbiomes to aggravate disease. Metagenomic data confirmed that low- and high-moisture conditions suppressed antibiotic biosynthesis genes but enriched pathogenicity-related genes, resulting in a change in the soil state from disease suppressive to inductive. This study highlights the importance of soil moisture when indigenous microbial suppression is harnessed for disease control. IMPORTANCE Soilborne diseases pose a major problem in high-intensity agricultural systems due to the imbalance of microbial communities in soil, resulting in the buildup of soilborne pathogens. Harnessing indigenous soil microbial suppression is an emerging strategy for overcoming soilborne plant diseases. In this study, we showed that soil moisture is a key factor in balancing microbiome effects on root rot disease. Proper soil moisture management represent an effective approach to maintain microbial disease resistance by enriching disease-suppressive microbiomes. Conversely, moisture stresses may enrich for a disease-inductive microbiome and aid accumulation of host-specific soilborne pathogens threatening crop production.

We present a global picture of the resistome by examining ARG-related papers retrieved from PubMed and published in the last 30 years (1990-2020). Natural Language Processing (NLP) was used to retrieve 496,640 papers, out of which 9374 passed the filtering test and were further analyzed to determine the distribution and diversity of ARG subtypes.

However, there are several potential environmental and health-related risks associated with this practice. One such risk stems from the fact that TWW irrigation may increase antibiotic resistance (AR) levels in soil bacteria, potentially contributing to the global propagation of clinical AR. Wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents have been recognized as significant environmental AR reservoirs due to selective pressure generated by antibiotics and other compounds that are frequently detected in effluents. This review summarizes a myriad of recent studies that have assessed the impact of anthropogenic practices on AR in environmental bacterial communities, with specific emphasis on elucidating the potential effects of TWW irrigation on AR in the soil microbiome. Based on the current state of the art, we conclude that contradictory to freshwater environments where WWTP effluent influx tends to expand antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) and antibiotic-resistant genes levels, TWW irrigation does not seem to impact AR levels in the soil microbiome. Although this conclusion is a cause for cautious optimism regarding the future implementation of TWW irrigation, we conclude that further studies aimed at assessing the scope of horizontal gene transfer between effluent-associated ARB and soil bacteria need to be further conducted before ruling out the possible contribution of TWW irrigation to antibiotic-resistant reservoirs in irrigated soils.",,impact of treated wastewater irrigation on antibiotic resistance in the soil microbiome,

Though digestate derived from food waste has been reported to partially replace fertilizer, its efficiency requires further improvement. In this study, the effects of digestate-encapsulated biochar were comprehensively investigated based on growth of an ornamental plant, soil characteristics, nutrient leaching and soil microbiome. Results showed that except for biochar, the tested fertilizers and soil additives, i.e., digestate, compost, commercial fertilizer, digestate-encapsulated biochar had positive effects on plants. Especially, the digestate-encapsulated biochar had the best effectiveness as evidenced by 9-25% increase in chlorophyll content index, fresh weight, leaf area and blossom frequency.

Mature-leaf folivores had greater individual microbiome variation, and taxa and metabolites putatively involved in cellulolysis. The consortia even differed between related, young-leaf specialists, with indri prioritizing metabolism of fiber and plant secondary compounds, and woolly lemurs prioritizing amino-acid cycling.

      The plant microbiome is an integral part of the host and increasingly recognized as playing fundamental roles in plant growth and health. Increasing evidence indicates that plant rhizosphere recruits beneficial microbes to the plant to suppress soil-borne pathogens. However, the ecological processes that govern plant microbiome assembly and functions in the below- and aboveground compartments under pathogen invasion are not fully understood. Here, we studied the bacterial and fungal communities associated with 12 compartments (e.g., soils, roots, stems, and fruits) of chili pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) using amplicons (16S and ITS) and metagenomics approaches at the main pepper production sites in China and investigated how Fusarium wilt disease (FWD) affects the assembly, co-occurrence patterns, and ecological functions of plant-associated microbiomes.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The amplicon data analyses revealed that FWD affected less on the microbiome of pepper reproductive organs (fruit) than vegetative organs (root and stem), with the strongest impact on the upper stem epidermis. Fungal intra-kingdom networks were less stable and their communities were more sensitive to FWD than the bacterial communities. The analysis of microbial interkingdom network further indicated that FWD destabilized the network and induced the ecological importance of fungal taxa. Although the diseased plants were more susceptible to colonization by other pathogenic fungi, their below- and aboveground compartments can also recruit potential beneficial bacteria. Some of the beneficial bacterial taxa enriched in the diseased plants were also identified as core taxa for plant microbiomes and hub taxa in networks. On the other hand, metagenomic analysis revealed significant enrichment of several functional genes involved in detoxification, biofilm formation, and plant-microbiome signaling pathways (i.e., chemotaxis) in the diseased plants.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Together, we demonstrate that a diseased plant could recruit beneficial bacteria and mitigate the changes in reproductive organ microbiome to facilitate host or its offspring survival. The host plants may attract the beneficial microbes through the modulation of plant-microbiome signaling pathways. These findings significantly advance our understanding on plant-microbiome interactions and could provide fundamental and important data for harnessing the plant microbiome in sustainable agriculture.

Although a few species of rhizobacteria have the ability to promote plant growth under drought, the drought tolerance of the soil microbiome and its relationship with the promotion of plant growth under drought are scarcely studied. This study aimed to develop a novel approach for assessing drought tolerance in agricultural land by quantitatively measuring microbial phenotypes using stable isotopes and Raman spectroscopy. Raman spectroscopy with deuterium isotope probing was used to identify the Raman signatures of drought effects from drought-tolerant bacteria. Counting drought-tolerant cells by applying these phenotypic properties to agricultural samples revealed that 0% to 52.2% of all measured single cells had drought-tolerant properties, depending on the soil sample. The proportions of drought-tolerant cells in each soil type showed similar tendencies to the numbers of revived pea plants cultivated under drought. The phenotype of the soil microbiome and plant behavior under drought conditions therefore appeared to be highly related. Studying metagenomics suggested that there was a reliable link between the phenotype and genotype of the soil microbiome that could explain mechanisms that promote plant growth in drought. In particular, the proportion of drought-tolerant cells was highly correlated with genes encoding phytohormone production, including tryptophan synthase and isopentenyl-diphosphate delta-isomerase; these enzymes are known to alleviate drought stress. Raman spectroscopy with deuterium isotope probing shows high potential as an alternative technology for quantitatively assessing drought tolerance through phenotypic analysis of the soil microbiome. IMPORTANCE Soil microbiome has played a critical role in the plant survival during drought. However, the drought tolerance of soil microbiome and its ability to promote plant growth under drought is still scarcely studied. In this study, we identified the Raman signature (i.e., phenotype) of drought effects from drought-tolerant bacteria in agricultural soil samples using Raman-deuterium isotope probing (Raman-DIP). Moreover, the number of drought-tolerant cells measured by Raman-DIP was highly related to the survival rate of plant cultivation under drought and the abundance of genes encoding phytohormone production alleviating drought stress in plant. These results suggest Raman-DIP is a promising technology for measuring drought tolerance of soil microbiome.

Using a combination of genome-resolved metagenomics and amplicon sequencing, we investigated the microbial mechanisms involved in phosphorus cycling under three agricultural treatments in a wheat-maize rotation system and two natural reforestation treatments. Available soil phosphorus was the key factor shaping bacterial and fungal community composition and function across our agricultural and reforestation sites. Membrane-bound quinoprotein glucose dehydrogenase (PQQGDH) and exopolyphosphatases (PPX) governed microbial phosphate solubilization in agroecosystems. In contrast, genes encoding glycerol-3-phosphate transporters (ugpB, ugpC, and ugpQ) displayed a significantly greater abundance in the reforestation soils. The gcd gene encoding PQQGDH was found to be the best determinant for bioavailable soil phosphorus. Metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) affiliated with Cyclobacteriaceae and Vicinamibacterales were obtained from agricultural soils. Their MAGs harbored not only gcd but also the pit gene encoding low-affinity phosphate transporters. MAGs obtained from reforestation soils were affiliated with Microtrichales and Burkholderiales. These contain ugp genes but no gcd, and thereby are indicative of a phosphate transporter strategy. Our study demonstrates that knowledge of distinct microbial phosphorus acquisition strategies between agricultural and reforestation soils could help in linking microbial processes with phosphorus cycling. IMPORTANCE The soil microbiome is the key player regulating phosphorus cycling processes. Identifying phosphate-solubilizing bacteria and utilizing them for release of recalcitrant phosphate that is bound to rocks or minerals have implications for improving crop nutrient acquisition and crop productivity. In this study, we combined functional metagenomics and amplicon sequencing to analyze microbial phosphorus cycling processes in natural reforestation and agricultural soils. We found that the phosphorus acquisition strategies significantly differed between these two ecosystems. A microbial phosphorus solubilization strategy dominated in the agricultural soils, while a microbial phosphate transporter strategy was observed in the reforestation soils.

Here, utilizing distinct sorghum genotypes, we characterized the chemical heterogeneity between root exudates and the effects of that variability on soil microbial membership and metabolism. Distinct exudate chemical profiles were quantified and used to formulate synthetic root exudate treatments: a high-organic-acid treatment (HOT) and a high-sugar treatment (HST). To parse the response of the soil microbiome to different exudate regimens, laboratory soil reactors were amended with these root exudate treatments as well as a nonexudate control. Amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene illustrated distinct microbial diversity patterns and membership in response to HST, HOT, or control amendments. Exometabolite changes reflected these microbial community changes, and we observed enrichment of organic and amino acids, as well as possible phytohormones in the HST relative to the HOT and control. Linking the metabolic capacity of metagenome-assembled genomes in the HST to the exometabolite patterns, we identified microorganisms that could produce these phytohormones.

IMPORTANCE Decrypting the chemical interactions between plant roots and the soil microbiome is a gateway for future manipulation and management of the rhizosphere, a soil compartment critical to promoting plant fitness and yields. Our experimental results demonstrate how soil microbial community and genomic diversity is influenced by root exudates of differing chemical compositions and how changes in this microbiome result in altered production of plant-relevant metabolites. Together, these findings demonstrate the tractability of high-resolution multiomics tools to investigate soil microbiomes and provide new information on plant-soil environments useful for the development of efficient and precise microbiota management strategies in agricultural systems.",soil,variation in root exudate composition influences soil microbiome membership and function,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35536051/

However, the scope of this phenomenon and the link to soil properties needs to be elucidated. This study compared the short-term effects of a range of gentamicin concentrations on the microbiome and resistome of bacterial enrichments and microcosms of an agricultural soil using a metagenomic approach. Gentamicin impact on bacterial biomass was roughly estimated by the number of 16SrRNA gene copies. In addition, the soil microbiome and resistome response to gentamicin pollution was evaluated by 16SrRNA gene and metagenomic sequencing, respectively. Finally, gentamicin bioavailability in soil was determined. While gentamicin pollution at the scale of µg/g strongly influenced the bacterial communities in soil enrichments, concentrations up to 1 mg/g were strongly adsorbed onto soil particles and did not cause significant changes in the microbiome and resistome of soil microcosms. This study demonstrates the differences between the response of bacterial communities to antibiotic pollution in enriched media and in their environmental matrix, and exposes the limitations of culture-based studies in antibiotic-resistance surveillance. Furthermore, establishing links between the effects of antibiotic pollution and soil properties is needed.",soil,gentamicin adsorption onto soil particles prevents overall short-term effects on the soil microbiome and resistome,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33672037/

      Global biodiversity losses threaten ecosystem services and can impact important functional insurance in a changing world. Microbial diversity and function can become depleted in agricultural systems and attempts to rediversify agricultural soils rely on either targeted microbial introductions or retaining natural lands as biodiversity reservoirs. As many soil functions are provided by a combination of microbial taxa, rather than outsized impacts by single taxa, such functions may benefit more from diverse microbiome additions than additions of individual commercial strains. In this study, we measured the impact of soil microbial diversity loss and rediversification (i.e. rescue) on nitrification by quantifying ammonium and nitrate pools. We manipulated microbial assemblages in two distinct soil types, an agricultural and a forest soil, with a dilution-to-extinction approach and performed a microbiome rediversification experiment by re-introducing microorganisms lost from the dilution. A microbiome water control was included to act as a reference point. We assessed disruption and potential restoration of (1) nitrification, (2) bacterial and fungal composition through 16S rRNA gene and fungal ITS amplicon sequencing and (3) functional genes through shotgun metagenomic sequencing on a subset of samples.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Disruption of nitrification corresponded with diversity loss, but nitrification was successfully rescued in the rediversification experiment when high diversity inocula were introduced. Bacterial composition clustered into groups based on high and low diversity inocula. Metagenomic data showed that genes responsible for the conversion of nitrite to nitrate and taxa associated with nitrogen metabolism were absent in the low diversity inocula microcosms but were rescued with high diversity introductions.

Currently, a limited number of prokaryotic MTs have been experimentally identified, which necessitates the expansion of bacterial MT diversity. In this study, we conducted a metagenomics-guided analysis for the discovery of potential bacterial MT genes from the soil microbiome. More specifically, we combined resistance gene enrichment through diversity loss, metagenomic mining with a dedicated MT database, evolutionary trace analysis, DNA chemical synthesis, and functional genomic validation to identify novel MTs. Results showed that Cu stress induced a compositional change in the soil microbiome, with an enrichment of metal-resistant bacteria in soils with higher Cu concentrations. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing was performed to obtain the gene pool of environmental DNA (eDNA), which was subjected to a local BLAST search against an MT database for detecting putative MT genes. Evolutional trace analysis led to the identification of 27 potential MTs with conserved cysteine/histidine motifs different from those of known prokaryotic MTs. Following chemical synthesis of these 27 potential MT genes and heterologous expression in Escherichia coli, six of them were found to improve the hosts' growth substantially and enhanced the hosts' sorption of Cu, Cd, and Zn, among which MT5 led to a 13.7-fold increase in Cd accumulation. Furthermore, four of them restored Cu and/or Cd resistance in two metal-sensitive E. coli strains.IMPORTANCE The metagenomics-guided procedure developed here bypasses the difficulties encountered in classic PCR-based approaches and led to the discovery of novel MT genes, which may be useful in developing bioremediation tools.

In barren drylands, keystone taxa drive microbial structure and functioning in soil environments. In the current study, the Chinese Loess plateau's agricultural (AL) and twenty-year-old rehabilitated lands (RL) provided a unique opportunity to investigate land-use-mediated effects on barren soil keystone bacterial and fungal taxa. Therefore, soils from eighteen sites were collected for metagenomic sequencing of bacteria specific 16S rRNA and fungi specific ITS2 regions, respectively, and to conduct molecular ecological networks and construct microbial OTU-based correlation matrices. In RL soils we found a more complex bacterial network represented by a higher number of nodes and links, with a link percentage of 77%, and a lower number of nodes and links for OTU-based fungal networks compared to the AL soils. A higher number of keystone taxa was observed in the RL (66) than in the AL (49) soils, and microbial network connectivity was positively influenced by soil total nitrogen and microbial biomass carbon contents.

      Soil microorganisms can mediate the occurrence of plant diseases. Potato common scab (CS) is a refractory disease caused by pathogenic Streptomyces that occurs worldwide, but little is known about the interactions between CS and the soil microbiome. In this study, four soil-root system compartments (geocaulosphere soil (GS), rhizosphere soil (RS), root-zone soil (ZS), and furrow soil (FS)) were analyzed for potato plants with naturally high (H) and low (L) scab severity levels. We aimed to determine the composition and putative function of the soil microbiome associated with potato CS.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The copy numbers of the scab phytotoxin biosynthetic gene txtAB and the bacterial 16S rRNA gene as well as the diversity and composition of each of the four soil-root system compartments were examined; GS was the only compartment that exhibited significant differences between the H and L groups. Compared to the H group, the L group exhibited a lower txtAB gene copy number, lower bacterial 16S copy number, higher diversity, higher co-occurrence network complexity, and higher community function similarity within the GS microbiome. The community composition and function of the GS samples were further revealed by shotgun metagenomic sequencing. Variovorax, Stenotrophomonas, and Agrobacterium were the most abundant genera that were significantly and positively correlated with the scab severity level, estimated absolute abundance (EAA) of pathogenic Streptomyces, and txtAB gene copy number. In contrast, Geobacillus, Curtobacterium, and unclassified Geodermatophilaceae were significantly negatively correlated with these three parameters. Compared to the function profiles in the L group, several genes involved in ""ABC transporters,"" the ""bacterial secretion system,"" ""quorum sensing (QS),"" ""nitrogen metabolism,"" and some metabolism by cytochrome P450 were enriched in the H group. In contrast, some antibiotic biosynthesis pathways were enriched in the L group. Based on the differences in community composition and function, a simple model was proposed to explain the putative relationships between the soil microbiome and CS occurrence.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The GS microbiome was closely associated with CS severity in the soil-root system, and the occurrence of CS was accompanied by changes in community composition and function. The differential functions provide new clues to elucidate the mechanism underlying the interaction between CS occurrence and the soil microbiome, and varying community compositions provide novel insights into CS occurrence.",soil,the occurrence of potato common scab correlates with the community composition and function of the geocaulosphere soil microbiome,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30709420/

In hyperarid desert environments, where life itself becomes scarce and loses diversity, the interactions between viruses and host populations have remained elusive. Here, we resolved host-virus interactions in the soil metagenomes of the Atacama Desert hyperarid core, one of the harshest terrestrial environments on Earth. We show evidence of diverse viruses infecting a wide range of hosts found in sites up to 205 km apart. Viral genomes carried putative extremotolerance features (i.e., spore formation proteins) and auxiliary metabolic genes, indicating that viruses could mediate the spread of microbial resilience against environmental stress across the desert. We propose a mutualistic model of host-virus interactions in the hyperarid core where viruses seek protection in microbial cells as lysogens or pseudolysogens, while viral extremotolerance genes aid survival of their hosts. Our results suggest that the host-virus interactions in the Atacama Desert soils are dynamic and complex, shaping uniquely adapted microbiomes in this highly selective and hostile environment.IMPORTANCE Deserts are one of the largest and rapidly expanding terrestrial ecosystems characterized by low biodiversity and biomass. The hyperarid core of the Atacama Desert, previously thought to be devoid of life, is one of the harshest environments, supporting only scant biomass of highly adapted microbes. While there is growing evidence that viruses play essential roles in shaping the diversity and structure of nearly every ecosystem, very little is known about the role of viruses in desert soils, especially where viral contact with viable hosts is significantly reduced. Our results demonstrate that diverse viruses are widely dispersed across the desert, potentially spreading key stress resilience and metabolic genes to ensure host survival. The desertification accelerated by climate change expands both the ecosystem cover and the ecological significance of the desert virome.

Here we used enrichment techniques in an attempt to decrease the complexity of a soil microbiome prior to sequencing by submitting it to a range of physical and chemical stresses in 23 separate microcosms for 4 months. The metagenomic analysis of these microcosms at the end of the treatment yielded 540 Mb of assembly using standard de novo assembly techniques (a total of 559,555 genes and 29,176 functions), from which we could recover novel bacterial genomes, plasmids and phages. The recovered genomes belonged to Leifsonia (n = 2), Rhodanobacter (n = 5), Acidobacteria (n = 2), Sporolactobacillus (n = 2, novel nitrogen fixing taxon), Ktedonobacter (n = 1, second representative of the family Ktedonobacteraceae), Streptomyces (n = 3, novel polyketide synthase modules), and Burkholderia (n = 2, includes mega-plasmids conferring mercury resistance). Assembled genomes averaged to 5.9 Mb, with relative abundances ranging from rare (<0.0001%) to relatively abundant (>0.01%) in the original soil microbiome. Furthermore, we detected them in samples collected from geographically distant locations, particularly more in temperate soils compared to samples originating from high-latitude soils and deserts. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first successful attempt to assemble multiple bacterial genomes directly from a soil sample.

Using metagenomic shotgun sequencing, firstly, we found soil microbes from natural environments (birthplace) greatly influenced the gut community assembly in the housing experiment. About 27% microbial species and 12% functional components that associated with birthplaces at Day 60 were still discriminatory of birthplaces after transferring mice to new environments. Moreover, prior soil-exposure types are associated with the magnitude of temporal microbiome change due to environmental shifts.

      Traditional agro-systems in arid areas are a bulwark for preserving soil stability and fertility, in the sight of ""reverse desertification"". Nevertheless, the impact of desert farming practices on the diversity and abundance of the plant associated microbiome is poorly characterized, including its functional role in supporting plant development under drought stress.
    


          Methodology/principal findings:
        
      
      We assessed the structure of the microbiome associated to the drought-sensitive pepper plant (Capsicum annuum L.) cultivated in a traditional Egyptian farm, focusing on microbe contribution to a crucial ecosystem service, i.e. plant growth under water deficit. The root system was dissected by sampling root/soil with a different degree of association to the plant: the endosphere, the rhizosphere and the root surrounding soil that were compared to the uncultivated soil. Bacterial community structure and diversity, determined by using Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis, differed according to the microhabitat, indicating a selective pressure determined by the plant activity. Similarly, culturable bacteria genera showed different distribution in the three root system fractions. Bacillus spp. (68% of the isolates) were mainly recovered from the endosphere, while rhizosphere and the root surrounding soil fractions were dominated by Klebsiella spp. (61% and 44% respectively). Most of the isolates (95%) presented in vitro multiple plant growth promoting (PGP) activities and stress resistance capabilities, but their distribution was different among the root system fractions analyzed, with enhanced abilities for Bacillus and the rhizobacteria strains. We show that the C. annuum rhizosphere under desert farming enriched populations of PGP bacteria capable of enhancing plant photosynthetic activity and biomass synthesis (up to 40%) under drought stress.

Here we investigate whether microbial activity hotspots also exist in lithic microhabitats in one of the most arid regions of the world, the Atacama Desert in Chile. While previous studies evaluated the total DNA fraction to elucidate the microbial communities, we here for the first time use a DNA separation approach on lithic microhabitats, together with metagenomics and other analysis methods (i.e., ATP, PLFA, and metabolite analysis) to specifically gain insights on the living and potentially active microbial community. Our results show that hypolith colonized rocks are microbial hotspots in the desert environment. In contrast, our data do not support such a conclusion for gypsum crust and salt rock environments, because only limited microbial activity could be observed. The hypolith community is dominated by phototrophs, mostly Cyanobacteria and Chloroflexi, at both study sites. The gypsum crusts are dominated by methylotrophs and heterotrophic phototrophs, mostly Chloroflexi, and the salt rocks (halite nodules) by phototrophic and halotolerant endoliths, mostly Cyanobacteria and Archaea.

      The microbiome of the Sinai Desert farming system plays an important role in the adaptive strategy of growing crops in a harsh, poly-extreme, desert environment. However, the diversity and function of microbial communities under this unfavorable moisture and nutritional conditions have not yet been investigated. Based on culturomic and metagenomic methods, we analyzed the microbial diversity and function of a total of fourteen rhizosphere soil samples (collected from twelve plants in four farms of the Sinai desert), which may provide a valuable and meaningful guidance for the design of microbial inoculants.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The results revealed a wide range of microbial taxa, including a high proportion of novel undescribed lineages. The composition of the rhizosphere microbial communities differed according to the sampling sites, despite similarities or differences in floristics. Whereas, the functional features of rhizosphere microbiomes were significantly similar in different sampling sites, although the microbial communities and the plant hosts themselves were different. Importantly, microorganisms involved in ecosystem functions are different between the sampling sites, for example nitrogen fixation was prevalent in all sample sites while microorganisms responsible for this process were different.

The Mu Us Desert (MUD), located in Northern China, is an aeolian desert. Although it has been governed by a series of ecological restoration programs, the MUD still has limited biological diversity. Populus euphratica (P. euphratica), a xerophytic plant, has great potential to improve the biological diversity of the MUD. However, the survival rate of P. euphratica in the MUD has been very low. The current study tried to explore the mechanism of the high death rate of P. euphratica in the microbiome perspective. The correlation study between soil community composition and soil properties showed that water-filled pore space (WFPS), pH, EC, AP, NO3 -, and NH4 + possess higher potential to change the bacterial community (18%) than the fungal community (9%). Principal coordinate analysis indicated that the composition of both bacteria (Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes) and fungi (Ascomycota) in the root soil can be increased by P. euphratica. By systematically comparing between the fungal diversity in the root soil around P. euphratica and the pathogenic fungus extract from the pathogenic site of P. euphratica, we found that the high death rate of P. euphratica was associated with specific pathogenic fungus Alternaria alternate and Didymella glomerata. In addition, the microbiome composition analysis indicated that P. euphratica planting could also influence the portions of bacteria community, which also has great potential to lead to future infection.

Moreover, we hypothesize that oligotrophic microbial communities harbor more unannotated genes. To test these hypotheses, we conducted metagenomic analyses of soil samples collected from copiotrophic vegetated areas and from oligotrophic bare ground devoid of vegetation in an arid-hyperarid region of the Sonoran Desert, Arizona, USA. Results supported our hypotheses, as we found that multiple ecologically informed life-history traits including average 16S ribosomal RNA gene copy number, codon usage bias in ribosomal genes and predicted maximum growth rate were higher for microbial communities in vegetated than bare soils, and that oligotrophic microbial communities in bare soils harbored a higher proportion of genes that are unavailable in public reference databases.

The results of our replicate sampling approach show that microbial communities are shaped primarily by soil characteristics associated with geographic locations, while rhizosphere associations are secondary factors. We found little difference between rhizosphere communities of the ecologically similar saguaro (Carnegiea gigantea) and cardón (Pachycereus pringlei) cacti. Both rhizosphere and soil communities were dominated by the disproportionately abundant Crenarchaeota class Thermoprotei, which comprised 18.7% of 183,320 total pyrosequencing reads from a comparatively small number (1,337 or 3.7%) of the 36,162 total operational taxonomic units (OTUs). OTUs common to both soil and rhizosphere samples comprised the bulk of raw sequence reads, suggesting that the shared community of soil and rhizosphere microbes constitute common and abundant taxa, particularly in the bacterial phyla Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Planctomycetes, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi, and Acidobacteria.

The majority of these microorganisms originate from deserts and drylands where the soil is laden with highly stress-resistant microbes capable of thriving under extreme environmental conditions, and a substantial portion of them survive long journeys through the atmosphere. This large-scale transmission of highly resilient alien microbial contaminants raises concerns with regards to the invasion of sensitive and/or pristine sink environments, and to human health-concerns exacerbated by increases in the rate of desertification. Further increases in the transport of dust-associated microbiota could extend the spread of foreign microbes to new ecosystems, increase their load in present sink environments, disrupt ecosystem balance, and potentially introduce new pathogens. Our present understanding of these microorganisms, their phylogenic affiliations and functional significance, is insufficient to determine their impact. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of available data regarding dust and sandstorm microbiota and their potential ramifications on human and ecosystem health. We conclude by discussing current gaps in dust and sandstorm microbiota research, and the need for collaborative studies involving high-resolution meta-omic approaches in conjunction with extensive ecological time-series studies to advance the field towards an improved and sufficient understanding of these invisible atmospheric travelers and their global ramifications.",soil,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29961874/

In Eastern Antarctic soils, bacterial primary production is supported by trace gas oxidation and the light-independent RuBisCO form IE. This study aims to determine if atmospheric chemosynthesis is widespread within Antarctic, Arctic and Tibetan cold deserts, to identify the breadth of trace gas chemosynthetic taxa and to further characterize the genetic determinants of this process. H2 oxidation was ubiquitous, far exceeding rates reported to fulfill the maintenance needs of similarly structured edaphic microbiomes. Atmospheric chemosynthesis occurred globally, contributing significantly (p < 0.05) to carbon fixation in Antarctica and the high Arctic. Taxonomic and functional analyses were performed upon 18 cold desert metagenomes, 230 dereplicated medium-to-high-quality derived metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) and an additional 24,080 publicly available genomes.

RuBisCO IE was discovered to co-occur alongside trace gas oxidation enzymes in representative Chloroflexota, Firmicutes, Deinococcota and Verrucomicrobiota genomes. We identify a novel group of high-affinity [NiFe]-hydrogenases, group 1m, through phylogenetics, gene structure analysis and homology modeling, and reveal substantial genetic diversity within RuBisCO form IE (rbcL1E), and high-affinity 1h and 1l [NiFe]-hydrogenase groups.

      The hyperarid core of the Atacama Desert is an extremely harsh environment thought to be colonized by only a few heterotrophic bacterial species. Current concepts for understanding this extreme ecosystem are mainly based on the diversity of these few species, yet a substantial area of the Atacama Desert hyperarid topsoil is covered by expansive boulder accumulations, whose underlying microbiomes have not been investigated so far. With the hypothesis that these sheltered soils harbor uniquely adapted microbiomes, we compared metagenomes and geochemistry between soils below and beside boulders across three distantly located boulder accumulations in the Atacama Desert hyperarid core.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Genome-resolved metagenomics of eleven samples revealed substantially different microbial communities in soils below and beside boulders, despite the presence of shared species. Archaea were found in significantly higher relative abundance below the boulders across all samples within distances of up to 205 km. These key taxa belong to a novel genus of ammonia-oxidizing Thaumarchaeota, Candidatus Nitrosodeserticola. We resolved eight mid-to-high quality genomes of this genus and used comparative genomics to analyze its pangenome and site-specific adaptations. Ca. Nitrosodeserticola genomes contain genes for ammonia oxidation, the 3-hydroxypropionate/4-hydroxybutyrate carbon fixation pathway, and acetate utilization indicating a chemolithoautotrophic and mixotrophic lifestyle. They also possess the capacity for tolerating extreme environmental conditions as highlighted by the presence of genes against oxidative stress and DNA damage. Site-specific adaptations of the genomes included the presence of additional genes for heavy metal transporters, multiple types of ATP synthases, and divergent genes for aquaporins.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      We provide the first genomic characterization of hyperarid soil microbiomes below the boulders in the Atacama Desert, and report abundant and highly adapted Thaumarchaeaota with ammonia oxidation and carbon fixation potential. Ca. Nitrosodeserticola genomes provide the first metabolic and physiological insight into a thaumarchaeal lineage found in globally distributed terrestrial habitats characterized by various environmental stresses. We consequently expand not only the known genetic repertoire of Thaumarchaeota but also the diversity and microbiome functioning in hyperarid ecosystems.

      The rhizosheath-root system is an adaptive trait of sandy-desert speargrasses in response to unfavourable moisture and nutritional conditions. Under the deserts' polyextreme conditions, plants interact with edaphic microorganisms that positively affect their fitness and resistance. However, the trophic simplicity and environmental harshness of desert ecosystems have previously been shown to strongly influence soil microbial community assembly. We hypothesize that sand-driven ecological filtering constrains the microbial recruitment processes in the speargrass rhizosheath-root niche, prevailing over the plant-induced selection.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Bacterial and fungal communities from the rhizosheath-root compartments (endosphere root tissues, rhizosheath and rhizosphere) of three Namib Desert speargrass species (Stipagrostis sabulicola, S. seelyae and Cladoraphis spinosa) along with bulk sand have been studied to test our hypothesis. To minimize the variability determined by edaphic and climatic factors, plants living in a single dune were studied. We assessed the role of plant species vs the sandy substrate on the recruitment and selection, phylogenetic diversity and co-occurrence microbial networks of the rhizosheath-root system microbial communities.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Microorganisms associated with the speargrass rhizosheath-root system were recruited from the surrounding bulk sand population and were significantly enriched in the rhizosheath compartments (105 and 104 of bacterial 16S rRNA and fungal ITS copies per gram of sand to up to 108 and 107 copies per gram, respectively). Furthermore, each rhizosheath-root system compartment hosted a specific microbial community demonstrating strong niche-partitioning. The rhizosheath-root systems of the three speargrass species studied were dominated by desert-adapted Actinobacteria and Alphaproteobacteria (e.g. Lechevalieria, Streptomyces and Microvirga) as well as saprophytic Ascomycota fungi (e.g. Curvularia, Aspergillus and Thielavia). Our results clearly showed a random phylogenetic turnover of rhizosheath-root system associated microbial communities, independent of the plant species, where stochastic factors drive neutral assembly. Co-occurrence network analyses also indicated that the bacterial and fungal community members of the rhizosheath-root systems established a higher number of interactions than those in the barren bulk sand, suggesting that the former are more stable and functional than the latter.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Our study demonstrates that the rhizosheath-root system microbial communities of desert dune speargrasses are stochastically assembled and host-independent. This finding supports the concept that the selection determined by the desert sand prevails over that imposed by the genotype of the different plant species.",,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30514367/

At the microhabitat scale, they also host hypolithic communities that live under semitranslucent stones. Both environmental niches experience exposure to extreme conditions such as high UV radiation, desiccation, temperature fluctuations, and resource limitation. However, hypolithic communities are somewhat protected from extremes relative to biocrust communities. Conditions are otherwise similar, so comparing them can answer outstanding questions regarding adaptations to environmental extremes. Using metagenomic sequencing, we assessed the functional potential of dryland soil communities and identified the functional underpinnings of ecological niche differentiation in biocrusts versus hypoliths. We also determined the effect of the anchoring photoautotroph (moss or cyanobacteria). Genes and pathways differing in abundance between biocrusts and hypoliths indicate that biocrust communities adapt to the higher levels of UV radiation, desiccation, and temperature extremes through an increased ability to repair damaged DNA, sense and respond to environmental stimuli, and interact with other community members and the environment. Intracellular competition appears to be crucial to both communities, with biocrust communities using the Type VI Secretion System (T6SS) and hypoliths favoring a diversity of antibiotics. The dominant primary producer had a reduced effect on community functional potential compared with niche, but an abundance of genes related to monosaccharide, amino acid, and osmoprotectant uptake in moss-dominated communities indicates reliance on resources provided to heterotrophs by mosses. Our findings indicate that functional traits in dryland communities are driven by adaptations to extremes and we identify strategies that likely enable survival in dryland ecosystems. IMPORTANCE Biocrusts serve as a keystone element of desert and dryland ecosystems, stabilizing soils, retaining moisture, and serving as a carbon and nitrogen source in oligotrophic environments. Biocrusts cover approximately 12% of the Earth's terrestrial surface but are threatened by climate change and anthropogenic disturbance. Given their keystone role in ecosystem functioning, loss will have wide-spread consequences. Biocrust microbial constituents must withstand polyextreme environmental conditions including high UV exposure, desiccation, oligotrophic conditions, and temperature fluctuations over short time scales. By comparing biocrust communities with co-occurring hypolithic communities (which inhabit the ventral sides of semitranslucent stones and are buffered from environmental extremes), we identified traits that are likely key adaptations to extreme conditions. These include DNA damage repair, environmental sensing and response, and intracellular competition. Comparison of the two niches, which differ primarily in exposure levels to extreme conditions, makes this system ideal for understanding how functional traits are structured by the environment.",soil,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35852333/

      The Black Sea is the largest brackish water body in the world, although it is connected to the Mediterranean Sea and presents an upper water layer similar to some regions of the former, albeit with lower salinity and temperature. Despite its well-known hydrology and physicochemical features, this enormous water mass remains poorly studied at the microbial genomics level.
    


          Results:
        
      
      We have sampled its different water masses and analyzed the microbiome by shotgun and genome-resolved metagenomics, generating a large number of metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from them. We found various similarities with previously described Black Sea metagenomic datasets, that show remarkable stability in its microbiome. Our datasets are also comparable to other marine anoxic water columns like the Cariaco Basin. The oxic zone resembles to standard marine (e.g. Mediterranean) photic zones, with Cyanobacteria (Synechococcus but a conspicuously absent Prochlorococcus), and photoheterotrophs domination (largely again with marine relatives). The chemocline presents very different characteristics from the oxic surface with many examples of chemolithotrophic metabolism (Thioglobus) and facultatively anaerobic microbes. The euxinic anaerobic zone presents, as expected, features in common with the bottom of meromictic lakes with a massive dominance of sulfate reduction as energy-generating metabolism, a few (but detectable) methanogenesis marker genes, and a large number of ""dark matter"" streamlined genomes of largely unpredictable ecology.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The Black Sea oxic zone presents many similarities to the global ocean while the redoxcline and euxinic water masses have similarities to other similar aquatic environments of marine (Cariaco Basin or other Black Sea regions) or freshwater (meromictic monimolimnion strata) origin. The MAG collection represents very well the different types of metabolisms expected in this kind of environment.

The ecological success of coral reefs relies on not only coral-algal symbiosis but also coral-microbial partnership. However, microbiome assemblages in the South China Sea corals remain largely unexplored. Here, we compared the microbiome assemblages of reef-building corals Galaxea (G. fascicularis) and Montipora (M. venosa, M. peltiformis, M. monasteriata) collected from five different locations in the South China Sea using massively-parallel sequencing of 16S rRNA gene and multivariate analysis. The results indicated that microbiome assemblages for each coral species were unique regardless of location and were different from the corresponding seawater. Host type appeared to drive the coral microbiome assemblages rather than location and seawater. Network analysis was employed to explore coral microbiome co-occurrence patterns, which revealed 61 and 80 co-occurring microbial species assembling the Galaxea and Montipora microbiomes, respectively. Most of these co-occurring microbial species were commonly found in corals and were inferred to play potential roles in host nutrient metabolism; carbon, nitrogen, sulfur cycles; host detoxification; and climate change.

In this pilot study, we present data on the phylogenetic and ecological structure of microorganisms from epipelagic water samples collected in the Small Aral Sea (SAS). The raw data were generated by massive parallel sequencing using the shotgun approach. As expected, most of the identified DNA sequences belonged to Terrabacteria and Actinobacteria (40% and 37% of the total reads, respectively). The occurrence of Deinococcus-Thermus, Armatimonadetes, Chloroflexi in the epipelagic SAS waters was less anticipated. Surprising was also the detection of sequences, which are characteristic for strict anaerobes-Ignavibacteria, hydrogen-oxidizing bacteria, and archaeal methanogenic species.

However, the processes involved in the assembly and dynamics of methanotrophic populations in complex natural microbial communities remain unclear. Here we investigated the development of a methanotrophic microbiome following subsurface mud eruptions at Håkon Mosby mud volcano (1250 m water depth). Freshly erupted muds hosted deep-subsurface communities that were dominated by Bathyarchaeota, Atribacteria and Chloroflexi. Methanotrophy was initially limited to a thin surface layer of Methylococcales populations consuming methane aerobically. With increasing distance to the eruptive center, anaerobic methanotrophic archaea, sulfate-reducing Desulfobacterales and thiotrophic Beggiatoaceae developed, and their respective metabolic capabilities dominated the biogeochemical functions of the community. Microbial richness, evenness, and cell numbers of the entire microbial community increased up to tenfold within a few years downstream of the mud flow from the eruptive center. The increasing diversity was accompanied by an up to fourfold increase in sequence abundance of relevant metabolic genes of the anaerobic methanotrophic and thiotrophic guilds. The communities fundamentally changed in their structure and functions as reflected in the metagenome turnover with distance from the eruptive center, and this was reflected in the biogeochemical zonation across the mud volcano caldera.

However, the interactions between the components within holobionts and between a holobiont and environment are largely unknown, especially for polar organisms. To investigate possible interactions within and between sponge-associated communities, we probed the microbiomes and viromes of cold-water sympatric sponges Isodictya palmata (n = 2), Halichondria panicea (n = 3), and Halichondria sitiens (n = 3) by 16S and shotgun metagenomics. We showed that the bacterial and viral communities associated with these White Sea sponges are species-specific and different from the surrounding water. Extensive mining of bacterial antiphage defense systems in the metagenomes revealed a variety of defense mechanisms. The abundance of defense systems was comparable in the metagenomes of the sponges and the surrounding water, thus distinguishing the White Sea sponges from those inhabiting the tropical seas. We developed a network-based approach for the combined analysis of CRISPR-spacers and protospacers. Using this approach, we showed that the virus-host interactions within the sponge-associated community are typically more abundant (three out of four interactions studied) than the inter-community interactions.

The taxonomic structure of the microbiome was determined using shotgun metagenomics and was confirmed by 16S amplicon analysis and quantitative PCR of the dsrB gene. The functional capacity was further analyzed by generating binned, genomic assemblies and performing flux-balance analysis on the metabolism of the dominant taxa.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The surface of the chain links showed intensive and localized corrosion with structural features typical of microbially induced corrosion. The microbiome on the links differed considerably from that of the surrounding sediment, suggesting selection for specific metal-corroding biofilms dominated by sulfur-cycling bacteria. The core metabolism of the microbiome was reconstructed to generate a mechanistic model that combines biotic and abiotic corrosion. Based on this metabolic model, we propose that sulfate reduction and sulfur disproportionation might play key roles in deep-sea corrosion.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The corrosion rate observed was higher than what could be expected from abiotic corrosion mechanisms under these environmental conditions. High corrosion rate and the form of corrosion (deep pitting) suggest that the corrosion of the chain links was driven by both abiotic and biotic processes. We posit that the corrosion is driven by deep-sea sulfur-cycling microorganisms which may gain energy by accelerating the reaction between metallic iron and elemental sulfur. The results of this field study provide important new insights on the ecophysiology of the corrosion process in the deep sea.",water,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35027090/

However, some taxa have been reported to reflect past depositional conditions suggesting they have experienced weak selection after burial. In sediments underlying the Arabian Sea oxygen minimum zone (OMZ), we performed the first metagenomic profiling of sedimentary DNA at centennial-scale resolution in the context of a multi-proxy paleoclimate reconstruction. While vertical distributions of sulfate reducing bacteria and methanogens indicate energy-based selection typical of anoxic marine sediments, 5-15% of taxa per sample exhibit depth-independent stratigraphies indicative of paleoenvironmental selection over relatively short geological timescales. Despite being vertically separated, indicator taxa deposited under OMZ conditions were more similar to one another than those deposited in bioturbated intervals under intervening higher oxygen. The genomic potential for denitrification also correlated with palaeo-OMZ proxies, independent of sediment depth and available nitrate and nitrite. However, metagenomes revealed mixed acid and Entner-Dourdoroff fermentation pathways encoded by many of the same denitrifier groups. Fermentation thus may explain the subsistence of these facultatively anaerobic microbes whose stratigraphy follows changing paleoceanographic conditions.

      For many environments, biome-specific microbial gene catalogues are being recovered using shotgun metagenomics followed by assembly and gene calling on the assembled contigs. The assembly is typically conducted either by individually assembling each sample or by co-assembling reads from all the samples. The co-assembly approach can potentially recover genes that display too low abundance to be assembled from individual samples. On the other hand, combining samples increases the risk of mixing data from closely related strains, which can hamper the assembly process. In this respect, assembly on individual samples followed by clustering of (near) identical genes is preferable. Thus, both approaches have potential pros and cons, but it remains to be evaluated which assembly strategy is most effective. Here, we have evaluated three assembly strategies for generating gene catalogues from metagenomes using a dataset of 124 samples from the Baltic Sea: (1) assembly on individual samples followed by clustering of the resulting genes, (2) co-assembly on all samples, and (3) mix assembly, combining individual and co-assembly.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The mix-assembly approach resulted in a more extensive nonredundant gene set than the other approaches and with more genes predicted to be complete and that could be functionally annotated. The mix assembly consists of 67 million genes (Baltic Sea gene set, BAGS) that have been functionally and taxonomically annotated. The majority of the BAGS genes are dissimilar (< 95% amino acid identity) to the Tara Oceans gene dataset, and hence, BAGS represents a valuable resource for brackish water research.

      Microbial colonization of subsurface shales following hydraulic fracturing offers the opportunity to study coupled biotic and abiotic factors that impact microbial persistence in engineered deep subsurface ecosystems. Shale formations underly much of the continental USA and display geographically distinct gradients in temperature and salinity. Complementing studies performed in eastern USA shales that contain brine-like fluids, here we coupled metagenomic and metabolomic approaches to develop the first genome-level insights into ecosystem colonization and microbial community interactions in a lower-salinity, but high-temperature western USA shale formation.
    


          Results:
        
      
      We collected materials used during the hydraulic fracturing process (i.e., chemicals, drill muds) paired with temporal sampling of water produced from three different hydraulically fractured wells in the STACK (Sooner Trend Anadarko Basin, Canadian and Kingfisher) shale play in OK, USA. Relative to other shale formations, our metagenomic and metabolomic analyses revealed an expanded taxonomic and metabolic diversity of microorganisms that colonize and persist in fractured shales. Importantly, temporal sampling across all three hydraulic fracturing wells traced the degradation of complex polymers from the hydraulic fracturing process to the production and consumption of organic acids that support sulfate- and thiosulfate-reducing bacteria. Furthermore, we identified 5587 viral genomes and linked many of these to the dominant, colonizing microorganisms, demonstrating the key role that viral predation plays in community dynamics within this closed, engineered system. Lastly, top-side audit sampling of different source materials enabled genome-resolved source tracking, revealing the likely sources of many key colonizing and persisting taxa in these ecosystems.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      These findings highlight the importance of resource utilization and resistance to viral predation as key traits that enable specific microbial taxa to persist across fractured shale ecosystems. We also demonstrate the importance of materials used in the hydraulic fracturing process as both a source of persisting shale microorganisms and organic substrates that likely aid in sustaining the microbial community. Moreover, we showed that different physicochemical conditions (i.e., salinity, temperature) can influence the composition and functional potential of persisting microbial communities in shale ecosystems. Together, these results expand our knowledge of microbial life in deep subsurface shales and have important ramifications for management and treatment of microbial biomass in hydraulically fractured wells.

Indeed, it has been suggested that consumption of these foods helps to address the negative consequences of ""industrialization"" of the human gut microbiota in Western society. However, as the mechanisms via which the microbes in fermented foods improve health are not understood, it is necessary to develop an understanding of the composition and functionality of the fermented-food microbiota to better harness desirable traits. Here, we considerably expand the understanding of fermented-food microbiomes by employing shotgun metagenomic sequencing to provide a comprehensive insight into the microbial composition, diversity, and functional potential (including antimicrobial resistance and carbohydrate-degrading and health-associated gene content) of a diverse range of 58 fermented foods from artisanal producers from a number of countries. Food type, i.e., dairy-, sugar-, or brine-type fermented foods, was the primary driver of microbial composition, with dairy foods found to have the lowest microbial diversity. From the combined data set, 127 high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), including 10 MAGs representing putatively novel species of Acetobacter, Acidisphaera, Gluconobacter, Companilactobacillus, Leuconostoc, and Rouxiella, were generated. Potential health promoting attributes were more common in fermented foods than nonfermented equivalents, with water kefirs, sauerkrauts, and kvasses containing the greatest numbers of potentially health-associated gene clusters. Ultimately, this study provides the most comprehensive insight into the microbiomes of fermented foods to date and yields novel information regarding their relative health-promoting potential.IMPORTANCE Fermented foods are regaining popularity worldwide due in part to a greater appreciation of the health benefits of these foods and the associated microorganisms.

The gene was cloned, expressed and characterized for redox activity, halophilicity, and thermal stability. The isolated thioredoxin reductase (ATII-TrxR) was found to belong to the high-molecular-weight class of thioredoxin reductases. A search for conserved domains revealed the presence of an extra domain (Crp) in the enzyme sequence. Characterization studies of ATII-TrxR revealed that the enzyme was halophilic (maintained activity at 4 M NaCl), thermophilic (optimum temperature was 65°C) and thermostable (60% of its activity was retained at 70°C).

Microbial communities show a high degree of spatial organization that stems from environmental gradients and local interactions. These interactions can be very complex and may involve multiple species. Several studies highlighted the importance of indirect interactions for community stability, but the absence of a theoretical framework for microbial ecology restricts the possibilities to strike a balance between the investigation of simple communities with purely pairwise interactions and the attempts to understand interaction patterns in whole communities based on meta-omics studies. Here we suggest adapting the concept of Associational Effects (AE) from plant ecology, to better understand the link between ecological interactions, spatial arrangement, and stability in microbial communities. By bringing together a conceptual framework developed for plants and observations made for microbes, this perspective article fosters synthesis of related disciplines to yield novel insights into the advancing field of spatial microbial ecology.

One important factor is the post-harvest process known as retting, representing the first step in the extraction of bast fibers from the stem of species such as flax and hemp. During this process microorganisms colonize the stem and produce hydrolytic enzymes that target cell wall polymers thereby facilitating the progressive destruction of the stem and fiber bundles.

      Britain's native oak species are currently under threat from acute oak decline (AOD), a decline-disease where stem bleeds overlying necrotic lesions in the inner bark and larval galleries of the bark-boring beetle, Agrilus biguttatus, represent the primary symptoms. It is known that complex interactions between the plant host and its microbiome, i.e. the holobiont, significantly influence the health status of the plant. In AOD, necrotic lesions are caused by a microbiome shift to a pathobiome consisting predominantly of Brenneria goodwinii, Gibbsiella quercinecans, Rahnella victoriana and potentially other bacteria. However, the specific mechanistic processes of the microbiota causing tissue necrosis, and the host response, have not been established and represent a barrier to understanding and managing this decline.

      We profiled the metagenome, metatranscriptome and metaproteome of inner bark tissue from AOD symptomatic and non-symptomatic trees to characterise microbiota-host interactions. Active bacterial virulence factors such as plant cell wall-degrading enzymes, reactive oxygen species defence and flagella in AOD lesions, along with host defence responses including reactive oxygen species, cell wall modification and defence regulators were identified. B. goodwinii dominated the lesion microbiome, with significant expression of virulence factors such as the phytopathogen effector avrE. A smaller proportion of microbiome activity was attributed to G. quercinecans and R. victoriana. In addition, we describe for the first time the potential role of two previously uncharacterised Gram-positive bacteria predicted from metagenomic binning and identified as active in the AOD lesion metatranscriptome and metaproteome, implicating them in lesion formation.

In addition, our field flux measurements from Norway spruce (Picea abies) canopies demonstrate both net CH4 emissions and uptake, giving further evidence that both production and consumption are relevant to the net CH4 exchange. Our findings, together with the emerging diversity of novel CH4 -producing microbial groups, strongly suggest microbial analyses should be integrated in the studies aiming to reveal the processes and drivers behind plant CH4 exchange.",plant,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33780002/

Contrarily to other Frankia clusters, the occurrence and mode of dispersal for infective cluster 2 units outside of the host plant rhizosphere remains controversial. The present study was designed to investigate the structure of the microbiomes of C. myrtifolia phytosphere, rhizosphere, and soil samples extending outward linearly up to 1 km. Results showed that the epiphyte and endophyte communities were not significantly different from each other for most of the plant tissues. The communities associated with the below-ground tissues (nodule and root) were significantly different from those found on the above-ground tissues (fruit, leaves, and stems) and had a higher community richness. Coriaria myrtifolia phytomicrobiomes were dominated by Cyanobacteria for leaf, stem, and fruit while Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria were dominant in the root and nodule organelles. The nodule, a special niche for nitrogen fixation, was mainly inhabited by Frankia but contained several non-Frankia bacteria. Beside Frankia cluster 2, the presence of clusters 1, 4, and large numbers of cluster 3 strains have been detected in nodules, roots, and rhizospheres of C. myrtifolia. Despite Frankia being found in all plots using plant trapping bioassays with C. myrtifolia seedlings, Frankia cluster 2 was not detected in soil metagenomes showing the limits of detection by this approach. This result also suggests that in the absence of appropriate host plant species, Frankia cluster 2 has a reduced number of infective units present in the soil outward from the rhizosphere.",plant,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36439809/

Their usage of bamboo can be classified temporally into a distinct leaf stage, shoot stage and transition stage. An association between this usage pattern and variation in the giant panda gut microbiome remains unknown. Here, we found associations using a gut metagenomic approach and nutritional analyses whereby diversity of the gut microbial community in the leaf and shoot stages was significantly different. Functional metagenomic analysis showed that in the leaf stage, bacteria species over-represented genes involved in raw fibre utilization and cell cycle control. Thus, raw fibre utilization by the gut microbiome was guaranteed during the nutrient-deficient leaf stage by reinforcing gut microbiome robustness. During the protein-abundant shoot stage, the functional capacity of the gut microbiome expanded to include prokaryotic secretion and signal transduction activity, suggesting active interactions between the gut microbiome and host. These results illustrate that seasonal nutrient variation in wild giant pandas substantially influences gut microbiome composition and function. Nutritional interactions between gut microbiomes and hosts appear to be complex and further work is needed.",,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28904137/

However, the functional associations between root microbes and host plant growth are poorly understood. This work investigates the root bacterial community of foxtail millet (Setaria italica) and its potential effects on host plant productivity. We determined the bacterial composition of 2882 samples from foxtail millet rhizoplane, rhizosphere and corresponding bulk soils from 2 well-separated geographic locations by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. We identified 16 109 operational taxonomic units (OTUs), and defined 187 OTUs as shared rhizoplane core OTUs. The β-diversity analysis revealed that microhabitat was the major factor shaping foxtail millet root bacterial community, followed by geographic locations. Large-scale association analysis identified the potential beneficial bacteria correlated with plant high productivity. Besides, the functional prediction revealed specific pathways enriched in foxtail millet rhizoplane bacterial community. We systematically described the root bacterial community structure of foxtail millet and found its core rhizoplane bacterial members. Our results demonstrated that host plants enrich specific bacteria and functions in the rhizoplane.

In the above ground tree tissues, leaves and stems have been the research focus point, while flush and flower microbiomes, two important tissues in the vegetative and reproductive cycles of the tree, are not well described. In this study, the fungal and bacterial taxa in five biocompartments (bulk soil, rhizosphere, root endosphere, flower and flush) of citrus trees grown in a single California orchard were profiled using an amplicon-based metagenomic Illumina sequencing approach. Trees with no observable signs of abiotic or biotic stresses were sampled for two consecutive years during the floral development phase. The rhizosphere was the most biodiverse compartment compared to bulk soil, root endosphere, flower and flush microbiomes. In addition, the belowground bacteriome was more diverse than the mycobiome. Microbial richness decreased significantly from the root exosphere to the endosphere and was overall low in the above ground tissues. Root endophytic microbial community composition shared strong similarities to the rhizosphere but also contained few taxa from above ground tissues. Our data indicated compartmentalization of the microbiome with distinct profiles between above and below ground microbial communities.

We herein report the results of comparative metagenome analyses on methylobacterial communities of soybean plants grown in an experimental field in Tohoku University (Kashimadai, Miyagi, Japan). Methylobacterium was identified as the most dominant genus (33%) among bacteria inhabiting soybean stems. We classified plant-derived Methylobacterium species into Groups I, II, and III based on 16S rRNA gene sequences, and found that Group I members (phylogenetically close to M. extorquens) were dominant in soybean-associated Methylobacterium. By comparing 29 genomes, we found that all Group I members possessed a complete set of genes for the N-methylglutamate pathway for methylamine utilization, and genes for urea degradation (urea carboxylase, urea amidolyase, and conventional urease). Only Group I members and soybean methylobacterial isolates grew in a culture supplemented with methylamine as the sole carbon source. They utilized urea or allantoin (a urea-related compound in legumes) as the sole nitrogen source; however, group III also utilized these compounds. The utilization of allantoin may be crucial in soybean-bacterial interactions because allantoin is a transported form of fixed nitrogen in legume plants. Soybean-derived Group I strain AMS5 colonized the model legume Lotus japonicus well. A comparison among the 29 genomes of plant-derived and other strains suggested that several candidate genes are involved in plant colonization such as csgG (curli fimbriae). Genes for the N-methylglutamate pathway and curli fimbriae were more abundant in soybean microbiomes than in rice microbiomes in the field.

Our inability to manage invasive species stems in part from a lack of understanding of the processes that control their successful establishment and spread. To date, studies have largely considered how above-ground processes control native/invasive plant interactions. Emerging research from terrestrial and wetland ecosystems demonstrates that below-ground processes under microbial control can determine the outcome of interactions between native and invasive plants. Whether sediment microbes modify the success of invasive macrophytes in marine ecosystems is untested, despite marine sediment microbes controlling many ecological processes (e.g. nutrient cycling) comparable to those in terrestrial ecosystems. We first show that sediment bacterial communities differ between the native seagrass Zostera capricorni and the invasive alga Caulerpa taxifolia and that those differences relate to functional changes in sulfur cycling between the macrophytes. Second, by experimentally manipulating the microbial communities we show that intact microbial communities in Z. capricorni sediments provide biotic resistance by reducing C. taxifolia fragment growth 119% compared to when they are inactive, and intact microbial communities in C. taxifolia sediments have positive feedbacks by increasing fragment growth 200%.

Acute Oak Decline (AOD) is characterized by necrotic stem lesions and galleries of the bark-boring beetle, Agrilus biguttatus, and represents a serious threat to oak. Although multiple novel bacterial species and Agrilus galleries are associated with AOD lesions, the causative agent(s) are unknown. The AOD pathosystem therefore provides an ideal model for a systems-based research approach to address our hypothesis that AOD lesions are caused by a polymicrobial complex. Here we show that three bacterial species, Brenneria goodwinii, Gibbsiella quercinecans and Rahnella victoriana, are consistently abundant in the lesion microbiome and possess virulence genes used by canonical phytopathogens that are expressed in AOD lesions. Individual and polyspecies inoculations on oak logs and trees demonstrated that B. goodwinii and G. quercinecans cause tissue necrosis and, in combination with A. biguttatus, produce the diagnostic symptoms of AOD. We have proved a polybacterial cause of AOD lesions, providing new insights into polymicrobial interactions and tree disease.

A comprehensive understanding of the assembly of the seed microbiome during seed development and maturation, the fate of microbes during storage, and the migration of microbes during seedling growth are still lacking. In this study, to understand the assembly and fate of endogenous bacteria in rice seeds from the ripening stage to the storage and seedling stages, we employed culture-dependent and metagenomic analyses. Bacterial communities in rice seeds were composed of a few dominant taxa that were introduced at the milky and dough stages, and they persisted during seed maturation. The culturable bacterial population gradually increased during the ripening stage, whereas there was a gradual decrease during storage. Bacteria that persisted during storage proliferated after imbibition and were distributed and established in the shoots and roots of rice seedlings. The storage temperature influenced the abundance of bacteria, which consequently changed the bacterial composition in the shoots and roots of seedlings. Pantoea, Pseudomonas, and Allorhizobium were consistently abundant from seed development to the germination stage. Some endogenous bacterial strains significantly promoted the growth of Arabidopsis and rice plants. Overall, our results indicate that rice seeds are colonized by a few bacterial taxa during seed development, and their relative abundance fluctuates during storage and contributes significantly to the establishment of endophytes in the stems and roots of rice plants. The selected bacterial isolates can be used to improve the growth and health of rice plants. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to reveal the dynamics of bacterial populations during storage of rice seeds at different temperatures.

Many studies have reported the biomethane potential of agro-industrial wastes, but only a few studies have investigated applying the substrates in both batch and continuous mode. Tomato is one of the most popular vegetables globally; its processing releases a substantial amount of by-product, such as stems and leaves. This study examined the BMP of tomato plant (Solanum lycopersicum Mill. L. cv. Alfred) waste. A comparative test revealed that the BMPs of corn stover, tomato waste,and their combination were approximately the same, around 280 mL methane/g Volatile Solid. In contrast, the relative biogas production decreased in the presence of tomato waste in a continuous mesophilic anaerobic digestion system; the daily biogas productions were 860 ± 80, 290 ± 50, and 570 ± 70 mL biogas/gVolatile Solid/day in the case of corn stover, tomato waste, and their mixture, respectively. The methane content of biogas was around 46-48%. The fermentation parameters of the continuous AD experiments were optimal in all cases; thus, TW might have an inhibitory effect on the microbial community. Tomato plant materials contain e.g. flavonoids, glycoalkaloids (such as tomatine and tomatidine), etc. known as antimicrobial and antifungal agents. The negative effect of tomatine on the biogas yield was confirmed in batch fermentation experiments. Metagenomic analysis revealed that the tomato plant waste caused significant rearrangements in the microbial communities in the continuously operated reactors. The results demonstrated that tomato waste could be a good mono-substrate in batch fermentations or a co-substrate with corn stover in a proper ratio in continuous anaerobic fermentations for biogas production. These results also point to the importance of running long-term continuous fermentations to test the suitability of a novel biomass substrate for industrial biogas production.",,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33730081/

      Research to understand and control microbiological risks associated with the consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables has examined many environments in the farm to fork continuum. An important data gap however, that remains poorly studied is the baseline description of microflora that may be associated with plant anatomy either endemically or in response to environmental pressures. Specific anatomical niches of plants may contribute to persistence of human pathogens in agricultural environments in ways we have yet to describe. Tomatoes have been implicated in outbreaks of Salmonella at least 17 times during the years spanning 1990 to 2010. Our research seeks to provide a baseline description of the tomato microbiome and possibly identify whether or not there is something distinctive about tomatoes or their growing ecology that contributes to persistence of Salmonella in this important food crop.
    


          Results:
        
      
      DNA was recovered from washes of epiphytic surfaces of tomato anatomical organs; leaves, stems, roots, flowers and fruits of Solanum lycopersicum (BHN602), grown at a site in close proximity to commercial farms previously implicated in tomato-Salmonella outbreaks. DNA was amplified for targeted 16S and 18S rRNA genes and sheared for shotgun metagenomic sequencing. Amplicons and metagenomes were used to describe ""native"" bacterial microflora for diverse anatomical parts of Virginia-grown tomatoes.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Distinct groupings of microbial communities were associated with different tomato plant organs and a gradient of compositional similarity could be correlated to the distance of a given plant part from the soil. Unique bacterial phylotypes (at 95% identity) were associated with fruits and flowers of tomato plants. These include Microvirga, Pseudomonas, Sphingomonas, Brachybacterium, Rhizobiales, Paracocccus, Chryseomonas and Microbacterium. The most frequently observed bacterial taxa across aerial plant regions were Pseudomonas and Xanthomonas. Dominant fungal taxa that could be identified to genus with 18S amplicons included Hypocrea, Aureobasidium and Cryptococcus. No definitive presence of Salmonella could be confirmed in any of the plant samples, although 16S sequences suggested that closely related genera were present on leaves, fruits and roots.",plant,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23705801/

We report a culture-independent, community-level assessment of apple flower microbial diversity and dynamics. We collected flowers from six apple trees at five time points, starting before flowers opened and ending at petal fall. We applied streptomycin to half of the trees when flowers opened. Assessment of microbial diversity using tag pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes revealed that the apple flower communities were rich and diverse and dominated by members of TM7 and Deinococcus-Thermus, phyla about which relatively little is known. From thousands of taxa, we identified six successional groups with coherent dynamics whose abundances peaked at different times before and after bud opening. We designated the groups Pioneer, Early, Mid, Late, Climax, and Generalist communities. The successional pattern was attributed to a set of prevalent taxa that were persistent and gradually changing in abundance. These taxa had significant associations with other community members, as demonstrated with a cooccurrence network based on local similarity analysis. We also detected a set of less-abundant, transient taxa that contributed to general tree-to-tree variability but not to the successional pattern. Communities on trees sprayed with streptomycin had slightly lower phylogenetic diversity than those on unsprayed trees but did not differ in structure or succession. Our results suggest that changes in apple flower microbial community structure are predictable over the life of the flower, providing a basis for ecological understanding and disease management.

Yet fundamental knowledge of flower-associated microbiotas remains largely unknown. Even less well understood are the changes that flower microbial communities experience through time. Flowers are particularly conducive to comprehensive temporal studies because they are, by nature, ephemeral organs. Here, we present the first culture-independent time series of bacterial and archaeal communities associated with the flowers of apple, an economically important crop. We found unexpected diversity on apple flowers, including a preponderance of taxa affiliated with Deinococcus-Thermus and TM7, phyla that are understudied but thought to be tolerant to an array of environmental stresses.

      Plant phenology has crucial biological, physical, and chemical effects on the biosphere. Phenological drivers have largely been studied, but the role of plant microbiota, particularly rhizosphere microbiota, has not been considered.
    


          Results:
        
      
      We discovered that rhizosphere microbial communities could modulate the timing of flowering of Arabidopsis thaliana. Rhizosphere microorganisms that increased and prolonged N bioavailability by nitrification delayed flowering by converting tryptophan to the phytohormone indole acetic acid (IAA), thus downregulating genes that trigger flowering, and stimulating further plant growth. The addition of IAA to hydroponic cultures confirmed this metabolic network.

      We document a novel metabolic network in which soil microbiota influenced plant flowering time, thus shedding light on the key role of soil microbiota on plant functioning.

We collected insect samples from the field, and found that an insect individual harbored an average of 12.2 × 10(5) microbial cells on its surface. A laboratory experiment showed that the microbial community composition on a flower surface changed after contact with an insect, suggesting that microbes are transferred from the insect to the flower. Comparison of the microbial fingerprint approach and direct visual observation under field condition suggested that the microbial community on a flower surface could to some extent indicate the structure of plant-pollinator interactions. In conclusion, species-specific insect microbial communities specific to insect species can be transferred from an insect body to a flower surface, and these microbes can serve as a ""fingerprint"" of the insect species, especially for large-bodied insects.

Here, the structure of the total bacterial community associated with the rhizosphere, endosphere and bulk soil of T. majus was determined by 16S rRNA amplicon metagenomic sequencing. A decrease in diversity and richness from bulk soil to the rhizosphere and from the rhizosphere to the endosphere was observed in the alpha diversity analyses. The phylum Proteobacteria was the most dominant in the bacteriome of the three sites evaluated, whereas the genera Pseudomonas and Ralstonia showed a significantly higher relative abundance in the rhizosphere and endosphere communities, respectively. Plant growth-promoting bacteria (236 PGPB) were also isolated from the T. majus endosphere, and 76 strains belonging to 11 different genera, mostly Serratia, Raoultella and Klebsiella, showed positive results for at least four out of six plant growth-promoting tests performed.

In this study, the fungal and bacterial taxa in five biocompartments (bulk soil, rhizosphere, root endosphere, flower and flush) of citrus trees grown in a single California orchard were profiled using an amplicon-based metagenomic Illumina sequencing approach. Trees with no observable signs of abiotic or biotic stresses were sampled for two consecutive years during the floral development phase. The rhizosphere was the most biodiverse compartment compared to bulk soil, root endosphere, flower and flush microbiomes. In addition, the belowground bacteriome was more diverse than the mycobiome. Microbial richness decreased significantly from the root exosphere to the endosphere and was overall low in the above ground tissues. Root endophytic microbial community composition shared strong similarities to the rhizosphere but also contained few taxa from above ground tissues. Our data indicated compartmentalization of the microbiome with distinct profiles between above and below ground microbial communities.

      The genus Allium (Family: Amaryllidaceae) is an economically important group of crops cultivated worldwide for their use as a vegetable and spices. Alliums are also well known for their nutraceutical properties. Among alliums, onion, garlic, leek, and chives cultivated worldwide. Despite their substantial economic and medicinal importance, the genome sequence of any of the Allium is not available, probably due to their large genome sizes. Recently evolved omics technologies are highly efficient and robust in elucidating molecular mechanisms of several complex life processes in plants. Omics technologies, such as genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, metagenomics, etc. have the potential to open new avenues in research and improvement of allium crops where genome sequence information is limited. A significant amount of data has been generated using these technologies for various Allium species; it will help in understanding the key traits in Allium crops such as flowering, bulb development, flavonoid biosynthesis, male sterility and stress tolerance at molecular and metabolite level. This information will ultimately assist us in speeding up the breeding in Allium crops.
    


          Method:
        
      
      In the present review, major omics approaches, and their progress, as well as potential applications in Allium crops, could be discussed in detail.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Here, we have discussed the recent progress made in Allium research using omics technologies such as genomics, transcriptomics, micro RNAs, proteomics, metabolomics, and metagenomics. These omics interventions have been used in alliums for marker discovery, the study of the biotic and abiotic stress response, male sterility, organ development, flavonoid and bulb color, micro RNA discovery, and microbiome associated with Allium crops. Further, we also emphasized the integrated use of these omics platforms for a better understanding of the complex molecular mechanisms to speed up the breeding programs for better cultivars.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      All the information and literature provided in the present review throws light on the progress and potential of omics platforms in the research of Allium crops. We also mentioned a few research areas in Allium crops that need to be explored using omics technologies to get more insight.

Pollen-associated viruses hitchhike on or within pollen grains and are transported to other plants by pollinators. They are deposited on flowers and have a direct pathway into the plant and next generation via seeds. To discover the diversity of pollen-associated viruses and identify contributing landscape and floral features, we perform a species-level metagenomic survey of pollen from wild, visually asymptomatic plants, located in one of four regions in the United States of America varying in land use. We identify many known and novel pollen-associated viruses, half belonging to the Bromoviridae, Partitiviridae, and Secoviridae viral families, but many families are represented. Across the regions, species harbor more viruses when surrounded by less natural and more human-modified environments than the reverse, but we note that other region-level differences may also covary with this. When examining the novel connection between virus richness and floral traits, we find that species with multiple, bilaterally symmetric flowers and smaller, spikier pollen harbored more viruses than those with opposite traits. The association of viral diversity with floral traits highlights the need to incorporate plant-pollinator interactions as a driver of pollen-associated virus transport into the study of plant-viral interactions.",plant,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35082293/

The composition of their bacteriota, for which the available knowledge is limited, is essential for their body's functioning. Based on our survey, we performed a metagenomic analysis of samples collected by repeated sampling. We used geolocations that represent the climatic types of the study area over two nutritionally extreme periods (March and May) of the collection season. Regarding bacteriome composition, a significant difference was found between the samples from March and May. The samples' bacteriome from March showed a significant composition difference between cooler and warmer regions. However, there were no significant bacteriome composition differences among the climatic classes of samples taken in May. Based on our results, one may conclude that the composition of healthy core bacteriomes in honey bees varies depending on the climatic and seasonal conditions. This is likely due to climatic factors and vegetation states determining the availability and nutrient content of flowering plants.

We aimed to measure the function and relative abundance of readily culturable putative plant growth-promoting rhizobacterial (PGPR) isolates from wheat root soil samples under contrasting inorganic fertilization regimes. We hypothesized that putative PGPR abundance will be reduced in fertilized relative to unfertilized samples. Triticum aestivum cv. Cadenza seeds were sown in a nutrient depleted agricultural soil in pots treated with and without Osmocote® fertilizer containing nitrogen-phosphorous-potassium (NPK). Rhizosphere and rhizoplane samples were collected at flowering stage (10 weeks) and analyzed by culture-independent (CI) amplicon sequence variant (ASV) analysis of rhizobacterial DNA as well as culture-dependent (CD) techniques. Rhizosphere and rhizoplane derived microbiota culture collections were tested for plant growth-promoting traits using functional bioassays. In general, fertilizer addition decreased the proportion of nutrient-solubilizing bacteria (nitrate, phosphate, potassium, iron, and zinc) isolated from rhizocompartments in wheat whereas salt tolerant bacteria were not affected. A ""PGPR"" database was created from isolate 16S rRNA gene sequences against which total amplified 16S rRNA soil DNA was searched, identifying 1.52% of total community ASVs as culturable PGPR isolates. Bioassays identified a higher proportion of PGPR in non-fertilized samples [rhizosphere (49%) and rhizoplane (91%)] compared to fertilized samples [rhizosphere (21%) and rhizoplane (19%)] which constituted approximately 1.95 and 1.25% in non-fertilized and fertilized total community DNA, respectively. The analyses of 16S rRNA genes and deduced functional profiles provide an in-depth understanding of the responses of bacterial communities to fertilizer; our study suggests that rhizobacteria that potentially benefit plants by mobilizing insoluble nutrients in soil are reduced by chemical fertilizer addition.

There is also a lack of understanding of enteric adaptations, including their unique microflora. To address these knowledge gaps, we used the douc as a model to study relationships between gastrointestinal microbial community structure and lifestyle. We analyzed published fecal samples as well as detailed dietary history from doucs with four distinct lifestyles (wild, semi-wild, semi-captive, and captive) and determined gastrointestinal bacterial microbiome composition using 16S rRNA sequencing.

The factors controlling the changes in the photosynthetic bacterial community during plant growth require further investigation. In this study, 35 microbial community samples were collected from the seedling, flowering, and mature stages of tomato, cucumber, and soybean plants. 35 microbial community samples were assessed using Illumina sequencing of the photosynthetic reaction center subunit M (pufM) gene. The results revealed significant alpha diversity and community structure differences among the three crops at the different growth stages. Proteobacteria was the dominant bacterial phylum, and Methylobacterium, Roseateles, and Thiorhodococcus were the dominant genera at all growth stages. PCoA revealed clear differences in the structure of the microbial populations isolated from leaf samples collected from different crops at different growth stages. In addition, a dissimilarity test revealed significant differences in the photosynthetic bacterial community among crops and growth stages (P<0.05).

Comparative analyses of microbiome features such as composition, abundance, and specificity, can shed light on bee ecology and the evolution of host-microbe interactions. Here we study microbiomes of ground-nesting cellophane bees (Colletidae: Diphaglossinae). From a microbial point of view, the diphaglossine genus Ptiloglossa is particularly remarkable: their larval provisions are liquid and smell consistently of fermentation. We sampled larval provisions and various life stages from wild nests of Ptiloglossa arizonensis and two species of closely related genera: Caupolicana yarrowi and Crawfordapis luctuosa. We also sampled nectar collected by P. arizonensis. Using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, we find that larval provisions of all three bee species are near-monocultures of lactobacilli. Nectar communities are more diverse, suggesting ecological filtering. Shotgun metagenomic and phylogenetic data indicate that Ptiloglossa culture multiple species and strains of Apilactobacillus, which circulate among bees and flowers. Larval lactobacilli disappear before pupation, and hence are likely not vertically transmitted, but rather reacquired from flowers as adults. Thus, brood cell microbiomes are qualitatively similar between diphaglossine bees and other solitary bees: lactobacilli-dominated, environmentally acquired, and non-species-specific. However, shotgun metagenomes provide evidence of a shift in bacterial abundance. As compared with several other bee species, Ptiloglossa have much higher ratios of bacterial to plant biomass in larval provisions, matching the unusually fermentative smell of their brood cells. Overall, Ptiloglossa illustrate a path by which hosts can evolve quantitatively novel symbioses: not by acquiring or domesticating novel symbionts, but by altering the microenvironment to favor growth of already widespread and generalist microbes.",,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37089560/

These potential energy sources could be degraded and fermented through microbial enzymatic activity, resulting in short chain fatty acids available to hosts. However, the contributions of individual microbiota members to polysaccharide digestion have remained unclear. Through analysis of bacterial isolate genomes and a metagenome of the honey bee gut microbiota, we identify that Bifidobacterium and Gilliamella are the principal degraders of hemicellulose and pectin. Both Bifidobacterium and Gilliamella show extensive strain-level diversity in gene repertoires linked to polysaccharide digestion. Strains from honey bees possess more such genes than strains from bumble bees. In Bifidobacterium, genes encoding carbohydrate-active enzymes are colocated within loci devoted to polysaccharide utilization, as in Bacteroides from the human gut. Carbohydrate-active enzyme-encoding gene expressions are up-regulated in response to particular hemicelluloses both in vitro and in vivo. Metabolomic analyses document that bees experimentally colonized by different strains generate distinctive gut metabolomic profiles, with enrichment for specific monosaccharides, corresponding to predictions from genomic data. The other 3 core gut species clusters (Snodgrassella and 2 Lactobacillus clusters) possess few or no genes for polysaccharide digestion. Together, these findings indicate that strain composition within individual hosts determines the metabolic capabilities and potentially affects host nutrition.

      Research to understand and control microbiological risks associated with the consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables has examined many environments in the farm to fork continuum. An important data gap however, that remains poorly studied is the baseline description of microflora that may be associated with plant anatomy either endemically or in response to environmental pressures. Specific anatomical niches of plants may contribute to persistence of human pathogens in agricultural environments in ways we have yet to describe. Tomatoes have been implicated in outbreaks of Salmonella at least 17 times during the years spanning 1990 to 2010. Our research seeks to provide a baseline description of the tomato microbiome and possibly identify whether or not there is something distinctive about tomatoes or their growing ecology that contributes to persistence of Salmonella in this important food crop.
    


          Results:
        
      
      DNA was recovered from washes of epiphytic surfaces of tomato anatomical organs; leaves, stems, roots, flowers and fruits of Solanum lycopersicum (BHN602), grown at a site in close proximity to commercial farms previously implicated in tomato-Salmonella outbreaks. DNA was amplified for targeted 16S and 18S rRNA genes and sheared for shotgun metagenomic sequencing. Amplicons and metagenomes were used to describe ""native"" bacterial microflora for diverse anatomical parts of Virginia-grown tomatoes.

      Distinct groupings of microbial communities were associated with different tomato plant organs and a gradient of compositional similarity could be correlated to the distance of a given plant part from the soil. Unique bacterial phylotypes (at 95% identity) were associated with fruits and flowers of tomato plants. These include Microvirga, Pseudomonas, Sphingomonas, Brachybacterium, Rhizobiales, Paracocccus, Chryseomonas and Microbacterium. The most frequently observed bacterial taxa across aerial plant regions were Pseudomonas and Xanthomonas. Dominant fungal taxa that could be identified to genus with 18S amplicons included Hypocrea, Aureobasidium and Cryptococcus. No definitive presence of Salmonella could be confirmed in any of the plant samples, although 16S sequences suggested that closely related genera were present on leaves, fruits and roots.",plant,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23705801/

      Recently, we reported that some dairy cows could produce high amounts of milk with high amounts of protein (defined as milk protein yield [MPY]) when a population was raised under the same nutritional and management condition, a potential new trait that can be used to increase high-quality milk production. It is unknown to what extent the rumen microbiome and its metabolites, as well as the host metabolism, contribute to MPY. Here, analysis of rumen metagenomics and metabolomics, together with serum metabolomics was performed to identify potential regulatory mechanisms of MPY at both the rumen microbiome and host levels.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Metagenomics analysis revealed that several Prevotella species were significantly more abundant in the rumen of high-MPY cows, contributing to improved functions related to branched-chain amino acid biosynthesis. In addition, the rumen microbiome of high-MPY cows had lower relative abundances of organisms with methanogen and methanogenesis functions, suggesting that these cows may produce less methane. Metabolomics analysis revealed that the relative concentrations of rumen microbial metabolites (mainly amino acids, carboxylic acids, and fatty acids) and the absolute concentrations of volatile fatty acids were higher in the high-MPY cows. By associating the rumen microbiome with the rumen metabolome, we found that specific microbial taxa (mainly Prevotella species) were positively correlated with ruminal microbial metabolites, including the amino acids and carbohydrates involved in glutathione, phenylalanine, starch, sucrose, and galactose metabolism. To detect the interactions between the rumen microbiome and host metabolism, we associated the rumen microbiome with the host serum metabolome and found that Prevotella species may affect the host's metabolism of amino acids (including glycine, serine, threonine, alanine, aspartate, glutamate, cysteine, and methionine). Further analysis using the linear mixed effect model estimated contributions to the variation in MPY based on different omics and revealed that the rumen microbial composition, functions, and metabolites, and the serum metabolites contributed 17.81, 21.56, 29.76, and 26.78%, respectively, to the host MPY.

      These findings provide a fundamental understanding of how the microbiome-dependent and host-dependent mechanisms contribute to varied individualized performance in the milk production quality of dairy cows under the same management condition. This fundamental information is vital for the development of potential manipulation strategies to improve milk quality and production through precision feeding.

Additionally, the method has been extended to include predictions based on other multi-dimensional data such as the metabolome, as well to combine genomic and metagenomic information.

As such, it provides a unique genetic resource for plant cell wall degrading microbial enzymes that could be used in the production of biofuels. The rumen and gastrointestinal tract harbor a dense and complex microbiome. To gain a greater understanding of the ecology and metabolic potential of this microbiome, we used comparative metagenomics (phylotype analysis and SEED subsystems-based annotations) to examine randomly sampled pyrosequence data from 3 fiber-adherent microbiomes and 1 pooled liquid sample (a mixture of the liquid microbiome fractions from the same bovine rumens). Even though the 3 animals were fed the same diet, the community structure, predicted phylotype, and metabolic potentials in the rumen were markedly different with respect to nutrient utilization. A comparison of the glycoside hydrolase and cellulosome functional genes revealed that in the rumen microbiome, initial colonization of fiber appears to be by organisms possessing enzymes that attack the easily available side chains of complex plant polysaccharides and not the more recalcitrant main chains, especially cellulose. Furthermore, when compared with the termite hindgut microbiome, there are fundamental differences in the glycoside hydrolase content that appear to be diet driven for either the bovine rumen (forages and legumes) or the termite hindgut (wood).",animal,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19181843/

      Dairy cattle (Bos taurus), especially Holstein cows, which are the highest-producing dairy animals and are widely bred to provide milk products to humans, rely critically on their associated gastrointestinal tract (GIT) microbiota to digest plant feed. However, the region-specific taxonomic composition and function of the GIT microbiome in dairy cattle and the mechanistic basis for the diet-induced effects remain to be elucidated. RESULTS: We collected 120 digesta samples from 10 GIT regions of 12 Holstein cows fed forage- and grain-based diets and characterized their GIT microbiome via functional shotgun metagenomics and the resolution of metagenome-assembled genomes. Our results demonstrated that the GIT microbiome was mainly partitioned into three distinct clusters, four-chambered stomach, small intestine, and large intestine. Moreover, we found that the four-chambered stomach microbiome with the highest diversity had a strong ability to degrade recalcitrant polysaccharide substrates, underpinned by the prevalence of potential cellulosome--producing and plant-derived polysaccharide utilization loci-encoding consortia. In contrast, the post-gastric intestinal microbiome orchestrated alternative fermentation pathways to adapt to nutrient availability and energy acquisition. Diet shifts selectively modified the metabolic cascades of the microbiome in specific GIT regions, evidenced by the loss of fiber-degrading taxa and increased hydrogen sinks in propionate after grain introduction.

Although most attention has been on modulation of the rumen microbiome to improve ruminant production, the role of the lower gut microbiome in host health and nutrition remains relatively unexplored. This work aimed to investigate the taxonomy and functional variations in the fecal microbiome of Brazilian beef cattle reared in two different production systems using a metagenomic approach. Sixty male beef cattle from six farms representing semi-intensive (I, n = 2) and traditional (T, n = 4) Brazilian beef production systems were enrolled in the study. Shotgun sequencing was used to characterize taxonomic and functional composition and diversity of the microbiome in fecal samples collected from each animal. Fecal samples were analyzed for copper (Cu), lead (Pb), nitrogen (N), phosphorous (P), selenium (Se), and zinc (Zn) and stable isotopes of carbon (13C) and nitrogen (15N). The fecal microbiome was influenced by the beef production systems with greater functional and lower taxonomic diversity in beef cattle feces from I systems compared with that from T systems. The concentration of N, P, and Zn was higher in beef cattle feces from I systems compared with that from T systems and was associated with taxonomic and functional profile of fecal microbiome in I system, suggesting the role of fecal nutrients in shaping system-specific microbiome. Semi-intensive management practices led to a more complex but less connected fecal microbiome in beef cattle. The microbial community in beef cattle feces from I systems was characterized by greater abundance of beneficial bacteria (phylum Firmicutes and butyrate-producing bacteria family Lachnospiraceae and genera Anaerostipes, Blautia, Butyrivibrio, Eubacterium, Roseburia, and Ruminococcus). In addition, the fecal abundance of microbial genes related to immune system, nutrient metabolism, and energy production was greater in beef cattle raised under I systems compared with that under T systems. Findings of the current study suggest that semi-intensive management practices could facilitate the development of a healthier and more efficient fecal microbiome in beef cattle by driving an increase in the abundance of beneficial bacteria and functional genes.",animal,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34956130/

      Antimicrobial resistance poses super challenges in both human health and livestock production. Rumen microbiota is a large reservoir of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), which show significant varations in different host species and lifestyles. To compare the microbiome and resistome between dairy cows and dairy buffaloes, the microbial composition, functions and harbored ARGs of rumen microbiota were explored between 16 dairy cows (3.93 ± 1.34 years old) and 15 dairy buffaloes (4.80 ± 3.49 years old) using metagenomics.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Dairy buffaloes showed significantly different bacterial species (LDA > 3.5 & P < 0.01), enriched KEGG pathways and CAZymes encoded genes (FDR < 0.01 & Fold Change > 2) in the rumen compared with dairy cows. Distinct resistive profiles were identified between dairy cows and dairy buffaloes. Among the total 505 ARGs discovered in the resistome of dairy cows and dairy buffaloes, 18 ARGs conferring resistance to 16 antibiotic classes were uniquely detected in dairy buffaloes. Gene tcmA (resistance to tetracenomycin C) presented high prevalence and age effect in dairy buffaloes, and was also highly positively correlated with 93 co-expressed ARGs in the rumen (R = 0.98 & P = 5E-11). In addition, 44 bacterial species under Lactobacillus genus were found to be associated with tcmA (R > 0.95 & P < 0.001). L. amylovorus and L. acidophilus showed greatest potential of harboring tcmA based on co-occurrence analysis and tcmA-containing contigs taxonomic alignment.

Unfortunately, most published molecular surveys fail to provide adequate detail about variability in the community structures of fecal bacteria within and across cattle populations. Using massively parallel pyrosequencing of a hypervariable region of the rRNA coding region, we profiled the fecal microbial communities of cattle from six different feeding operations where cattle were subjected to consistent management practices for a minimum of 90 days. We obtained a total of 633,877 high-quality sequences from the fecal samples of 30 adult beef cattle (5 individuals per operation). Sequence-based clustering and taxonomic analyses indicate less variability within a population than between populations. Overall, bacterial community composition correlated significantly with fecal starch concentrations, largely reflected in changes in the Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, and Firmicutes populations. In addition, network analysis demonstrated that annotated sequences clustered by management practice and fecal starch concentration, suggesting that the structures of bovine fecal bacterial communities can be dramatically different in different animal feeding operations, even at the phylum and family taxonomic levels, and that the feeding operation is a more important determinant of the cattle microbiome than is the geographic location of the feedlot.",animal,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21378055/

In this study, we applied metatranscriptomics to characterize the active rumen microbiomes of beef cattle with different feed efficiencies (efficient, n = 10; inefficient, n = 10) using total RNA sequencing. Active bacterial and archaeal compositions were estimated based on 16S rRNAs, and active microbial metabolic functions including carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) were assessed based on mRNAs from the same metatranscriptomic data sets. In total, six bacterial phyla (Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Spirochaetes, Cyanobacteria, and Synergistetes), eight bacterial families (Succinivibrionaceae, Prevotellaceae, Ruminococcaceae, Lachnospiraceae, Veillonellaceae, Spirochaetaceae, Dethiosulfovibrionaceae, and Mogibacteriaceae), four archaeal clades (Methanomassiliicoccales, Methanobrevibacter ruminantium, Methanobrevibacter gottschalkii, and Methanosphaera), 112 metabolic pathways, and 126 CAZymes were identified as core components of the active rumen microbiome. As determined by comparative analysis, three bacterial families (Lachnospiraceae, Lactobacillaceae, and Veillonellaceae) tended to be more abundant in low-feed-efficiency (inefficient) animals (P < 0.10), and one archaeal taxon (Methanomassiliicoccales) tended to be more abundant in high-feed-efficiency (efficient) cattle (P < 0.10). Meanwhile, 32 microbial metabolic pathways and 12 CAZymes were differentially abundant (linear discriminant analysis score of >2 with a P value of <0.05) between two groups. Among them, 30 metabolic pathways and 11 CAZymes were more abundant in the rumen of inefficient cattle, while 2 metabolic pathways and 1 CAZyme were more abundant in efficient animals. These findings suggest that the rumen microbiomes of inefficient cattle have more diverse activities than those of efficient cattle, which may be related to the host feed efficiency variation.IMPORTANCE This study applied total RNA-based metatranscriptomics and showed the linkage between the active rumen microbiome and feed efficiency (residual feed intake) in beef cattle. The data generated from the current study provide fundamental information on active rumen microbiome at both compositional and functional levels, which serve as a foundation to study rumen function and its role in cattle feed efficiency.

For agriculturally important taxa, the functionality of gastrointestinal bacteria has been studied with the primary goals of improving animal health and production performance. With respect to cattle, the digestive functions of bacteria in cattle are unarguably critical to digestion and positively impact production performance. Conversely, some research suggests that the gastrointestinal microbiome in chickens competes with the host for nutrients and produces toxins that can harm the host resulting in decreased growth efficiency. Concerning many other species including reptiles and cetaceans, some cataloging of fecal bacteria has been conducted, but the functionality within the host remains ambiguous.

Next-generation sequencing and other molecular techniques have uncovered novel features of the rumen microbiome. For instance, pyrosequencing of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene has revealed the taxonomic identity of bacteria and archaea to the genus level, and when complemented with barcoding adds multiple samples to a single run. Whole genome shotgun sequencing generates true metagenomic sequences to predict the functional capability of a microbiome, and can also be used to construct genomes of isolated organisms.

      The bovine rumen hosts a diverse and complex community of Eukarya, Bacteria, Archea and viruses (including bacteriophage). The rumen viral population (the rumen virome) has received little attention compared to the rumen microbial population (the rumen microbiome). We used massively parallel sequencing of virus like particles to investigate the diversity of the rumen virome in thirteen lactating Australian Holstein dairy cattle all housed in the same location, 12 of which were sampled on the same day.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Fourteen putative viral sequence fragments over 30 Kbp in length were assembled and annotated. Many of the putative genes in the assembled contigs showed no homology to previously annotated genes, highlighting the large amount of work still required to fully annotate the functions encoded in viral genomes. The abundance of the contig sequences varied widely between animals, even though the cattle were of the same age, stage of lactation and fed the same diets. Additionally the twelve animals which were co-habited shared a number of their dominant viral contigs. We compared the functional characteristics of our bovine viromes with that of other viromes, as well as rumen microbiomes. At the functional level, we found strong similarities between all of the viral samples, which were highly distinct from the rumen microbiome samples.

Two pens of cattle were used, with all cattle in one pen receiving metaphylaxis treatment (800 mg subcutaneous tulathromycin) at arrival to the feedlot, and all cattle in the other pen remaining unexposed to parenteral antibiotics throughout the study period. Fecal samples were collected from 15 selected cattle in each group just prior to treatment (Day 1), and again 11 days later (Day 11). Shotgun sequencing was performed on isolated metagenomic DNA, and reads were aligned to a resistance and a taxonomic database to identify alignments to antimicrobial resistance (AMR) gene accessions and microbiome content. Overall, we identified AMR genes accessions encompassing 9 classes of AMR drugs and encoding 24 unique AMR mechanisms. Statistical analysis was used to identify differences in the resistome and microbiome between the untreated and treated groups at both timepoints, as well as over time. Based on composition and ordination analyses, the resistome and microbiome were not significantly different between the two groups on Day 1 or on Day 11. However, both the resistome and microbiome changed significantly between these two sampling dates.

This review of culture-independent metagenomics studies revealed that normal microflora in the female bovine reproductive tract is reasonably consistently dominated by bacteria from the phyla Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, following by Actinobacteria, Fusobacteria and Tenericutes. Reproductive disease development in the female bovine reproductive tract was demonstrated across multiple studies to be associated with high relative abundances of bacteria from the phyla Bacteroidetes and Fusobacteria. Reduced bacterial diversity in the reproductive tract microbiome in some studies of cows diagnosed with reproductive diseases also indicated an association between dysbiosis and bovine reproductive health.

Those studies consistently found a strong positive correlation between Trueperella pyogenes and clinical endometritis, whereas other pathogens such as Escherichia coli, Fusobacterium necrophorum, Prevotella melaninogenica, and Bacteroides spp. were also commonly cocultured. In contrast, Streptococcus spp., Staphylococcus spp., and Bacillus spp. were usually isolated from healthy cows. Starting in 2010, culture-independent studies using PCR explored the microbiome of cows with metritis and clinical endometritis, and observed that E. coli was a pioneer pathogen that predisposed cows to infection with F. necrophorum, which was strongly associated with metritis, and to infection with T. pyogenes, which was strongly associated with clinical endometritis. Starting in 2011, culture-independent studies using metagenomic sequencing expanded our knowledge of the uterine microbiome. It has been shown that cows have bacteria in the uterus even before calving, they have an established uterine microbiome within 20 min of calving, and that the microbiome structure is identical between cows that develop metritis and healthy cows until 2 d postpartum, after which the bacterial structure of cows that developed metritis deviates in favor of greater relative abundance of Bacteroidetes and Fusobacteria and lesser relative abundance of Proteobacteria and Tenericutes. The shift in the uterine microbiome in cows that develop metritis is characterized by a loss of heterogeneity and a decrease in bacterial richness. At the genus level, Bacteroides, Porphyromonas, and Fusobacterium have the strongest association with metritis. At the species level, we observed that Bacteroides pyogenes, Porphyromonas levii, and Helcococcus ovis were potential emerging uterine pathogens. Finally, we have shown that the hematogenous route is a viable route of uterine infection with uterine pathogens. Herein, we propose that metritis is associated with a dysbiosis of the uterine microbiota characterized by decreased richness, and an increase in Bacteroidetes and Fusobacteria, particularly Bacteroides, Porphyromonas, and Fusobacterium.",animal,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31587913/

We sampled 3,055 small animals from 20 provinces and then outlined the spectra of mammalian viruses within these individuals and the basic ecological and genetic characteristics of novel rodent and shrew viruses among the viral spectra. Further analysis revealed that host taxonomy plays a primary role and geographical location plays a secondary role in determining viral diversity.

Phylogram comparison between viruses and hosts indicated that host shifts commonly happened in many different species during viral evolutionary history.

      Animals evolved in a microbial world, and their gut microbial symbionts have played a role in their ecological diversification. While many recent studies report patterns of phylosymbiosis between hosts and their gut bacteria, fewer studies examine the potentially adaptive functional contributions of these microbes to the dietary habits of their hosts. In this study, we examined predicted metabolic pathways in the gut bacteria of more than 500 individual bats belonging to 60 species and compare the enrichment of these functions across hosts with distinct dietary ecologies.
    


          Results:
        
      
      We found that predicted microbiome functions were differentially enriched across hosts with different diets. Using a machine-learning approach, we also found that inferred microbiome functions could be used to predict specialized host diets with reasonable accuracy. We detected a relationship between both host phylogeny and diet with respect to microbiome functional repertoires. Because many predicted functions could potentially fill nutritional gaps for bats with specialized diets, we considered pathways discriminating dietary niches as traits of the host and fit them to comparative phylogenetic models of evolution. Our results suggest that some, but not all, predicted microbiome functions may evolve toward adaptive optima and thus be visible to the forces of natural selection operating on hosts over evolutionary time.

The URT-microbiome network consisting of bacteria, archaea, and RNA viruses was built and analyzed from aspects of core/periphery species, cluster composition, and balance between positive and negative interactions. It is discovered that the URT microbiome in the COVID-19 patients is enriched with Enterobacteriaceae, a gut associated family containing many pathogens. These pathogens formed a dense cooperative guild that seemed to suppress beneficial microbes collectively. Besides bacteria and archaea, 72 eukaryotic RNA viruses were identified in the URT microbiome of COVID-19 patients. Only five of these viruses were present in more than 10% of all samples, including SARS-CoV-2 and a bat coronavirus (i.e., BatCoV BM48-31) not detected in humans by routine means. SARS-CoV-2 was inhibited by a cooperative alliance of 89 species, but seems to cooperate with BatCoV BM48-31 given their statistically significant, positive correlations. The presence of cooperative bat-coronavirus partner of SARS-CoV-2 (BatCoV BM48-31), which was previously discovered in bat but not in humans to the best of our knowledge, is puzzling and deserves further investigation given their obvious implications. Possible microbial translocation mechanism from gut to URT also deserves future studies.",animal,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36509943/

Here, we present the first viral metagenomic analysis of Pipistrellus pygmaeus from Uppsala, Sweden. Total RNA was extracted from the saliva and feces of individual bats and analyzed using Illumina sequencing. The results identified sequences related to 51 different viral families, including vertebrate, invertebrate, and plant viruses. These viral families include Coronaviridae, Picornaviridae, Dicistroviridae, Astroviridae, Hepeviridae, Reoviridae, Botourmiaviridae, Lispviridae, Totiviridae, Botoumiaviridae, Parvoviridae, Retroviridae, Adenoviridae, and Partitiviridae, as well as different unclassified viruses. We further characterized three near full-length genome sequences of bat coronaviruses. A phylogenetic analysis showed that these belonged to alphacoronaviruses with the closest similarity (78-99% at the protein level) to Danish and Finnish bat coronaviruses detected in Pipistrellus and Myotis bats. In addition, the full-length and the near full-length genomes of picornavirus were characterized. These showed the closest similarity (88-94% at the protein level) to bat picornaviruses identified in Chinese bats. Altogether, the results of this study show that Swedish Pipistrellus bats harbor a great diversity of viruses, some of which are closely related to mammalian viruses.

We characterized the virome in guano from five common bat species in 9 Northern California roosts and from a pool of 5 individual bats. Genomes belonging to 14 viral families known to infect mammals and 17 viral families infecting insects or of unknown tropism were detected. Nearly complete or complete genomes of a novel parvovirus, astrovirus, nodavirus, circular Rep-encoding single-stranded DNA (CRESS-DNA) viruses, and densoviruses, and more partial genomes of a novel alphacoronavirus and a bunyavirus were characterized. Lower numbers of reads with >90% amino acid identity to previously described calicivirus, circovirus, adenoviruses, hepatovirus, bocaparvoviruses, and polyomavirus in other bat species were also found, likely reflecting their wide distribution among different bats. Unexpectedly, a few sequence reads of canine parvovirus 2 and the recently described mouse kidney parvovirus were also detected and their presence confirmed by PCR; these possibly originated from guano contamination by carnivores and rodents. The majority of eukaryotic viral reads were highly divergent, indicating that numerous viruses still remain to be characterized, even from such a heavily investigated order as Chiroptera.IMPORTANCE Characterizing the bat virome is important for understanding viral diversity and detecting viral spillover between animal species. Using an unbiased metagenomics method, we characterize the virome in guano collected from multiple roosts of common Northern California bat species. We describe several novel viral genomes and report the detection of viruses with close relatives reported in other bat species, likely reflecting cross-species transmissions.

Of particular interest is an adaptation to extreme diets, such as blood, which poses special challenges in its content of proteins and lack of essential nutrients. In this study, we assessed taxonomic signatures (by 16S rRNA amplicon profiling) and potential functional signatures (inferred by Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States (PICRUSt)) of haematophagy in birds and bats. Our goal was to test three alternative hypotheses: no convergence of microbiomes, convergence in taxonomy and convergence in function. We find a statistically significant effect of haematophagy in terms of microbial taxonomic convergence across the blood-feeding bats and birds, although this effect is small compared to the differences found between haematophagous and non-haematophagous species within the two host clades. We also find some evidence of convergence at the predicted functional level, although it is possible that the lack of metagenomic data and the poor representation of microbial lineages adapted to haematophagy in genome databases limit the power of this approach. The results provide a paradigm for exploring convergent microbiome evolution replicated with independent contrasts in different host lineages.

Hence, the interest in bat virus discovery has been increasing rapidly over the last decade. So far, most studies have focused on a single type of virus detection method, either PCR, virus isolation or virome sequencing. Here we present a comprehensive approach in virus discovery, using all three discovery methods on samples from the same bats. By family-specific PCR screening we found sequences of paramyxoviruses, adenoviruses, herpesviruses and one coronavirus. By cell culture we isolated a novel bat adenovirus and bat orthoreovirus. Virome sequencing revealed viral sequences of ten different virus families and orders: three bat nairoviruses, three phenuiviruses, one orbivirus, one rotavirus, one orthoreovirus, one mononegavirus, five parvoviruses, seven picornaviruses, three retroviruses, one totivirus and two thymoviruses were discovered. Of all viruses identified by family-specific PCR in the original samples, none was found by metagenomic sequencing. Vice versa, none of the viruses found by the metagenomic virome approach was detected by family-specific PCRs targeting the same family.

Vector range expansion and anthropogenic factors such as habitat encroachment and climate change are altering viral evolutionary dynamics and exposure. However, little is known about the diversity of viruses present in these populations. Small felid populations with lower genetic diversity are likely to be most threatened with extinction by emerging diseases, as with other selective pressures, due to having less adaptive potential. We used a metagenomic approach to identify novel circoviruses, which may have a negative impact on the population viability, from confirmed bobcat (Lynx rufus) and puma (Puma concolor) scats collected in Sonora, Mexico. Given some circoviruses are known to cause disease in their hosts, such as porcine and avian circoviruses, we took a non-invasive approach using scat to identify circoviruses in free-roaming bobcats and puma. Three circovirus genomes were determined, and, based on the current species demarcation, they represent two novel species. Phylogenetic analyses reveal that one circovirus species is more closely related to rodent associated circoviruses and the other to bat associated circoviruses, sharing highest genome-wide pairwise identity of approximately 70% and 63%, respectively. At this time, it is unknown whether these scat-derived circoviruses infect felids, their prey, or another organism that might have had contact with the scat in the environment.

Through viral metagenomics a large diversity of single-stranded (ss) DNA viruses have been identified. Here we examine the ssDNA virome of the hematophagous New Zealand blackfly using viral metagenomics. Our investigation reveals a plethora of novel ssDNA viral genomes, some of which cluster in the viral families Genomoviridae (n = 9), Circoviridae (n = 1), and Microviridae (n = 108), others in putative families that, at present, remain unclassified (n = 20) and one DNA molecule that only encodes a replication associated protein. Among these novel viruses, two putative multi-component virus genomes were recovered, and these are most closely related to a Tongan flying fox faeces-associated multi-component virus. Given that the only other known multi-component circular replication-associated (Rep) protein encoding single-stranded (CRESS) DNA viruses infecting plants are in the families Geminiviridae (members of the genus Begomovirus) and Nanoviridae, it appears these are likely a new multi-component virus group which may be associated with animals.

Here, we assessed gut microbiomes from ∼900 vertebrate species, including 315 mammals and 491 birds, assessing contributions of diet, phylogeny, and physiology to structuring gut microbiomes. In most nonflying mammals, strong correlations exist between microbial community similarity, host diet, and host phylogenetic distance up to the host order level. In birds, by contrast, gut microbiomes are only very weakly correlated to diet or host phylogeny. Furthermore, while most microbes resident in mammalian guts are present in only a restricted taxonomic range of hosts, most microbes recovered from birds show little evidence of host specificity. Notably, among the mammals, bats host especially bird-like gut microbiomes, with little evidence for correlation to host diet or phylogeny. This suggests that host-gut microbiome phylosymbiosis depends on factors convergently absent in birds and bats, potentially associated with physiological adaptations to flight. Our findings expose major variations in the behavior of these important symbioses in endothermic vertebrates and may signal fundamental evolutionary shifts in the cost/benefit framework of the gut microbiome.IMPORTANCE In this comprehensive survey of microbiomes of >900 species, including 315 mammals and 491 birds, we find a striking convergence of the microbiomes of birds and animals that fly. In nonflying mammals, diet and short-term evolutionary relatedness drive the microbiome, and many microbial species are specific to a particular kind of mammal, but flying mammals and birds break this pattern with many microbes shared across different species, with little correlation either with diet or with relatedness of the hosts.

Given the ability of the microbiome to impact host fitness, there is increasing interest in studying the microbiome of wild animals to better understand these communities in the context of host ecology and evolution. Human microbiome research protocols are well established, but wildlife microbiome research is still a developing field. Currently, there is no standardized set of best practices guiding the collection of microbiome samples from wildlife. Gut microflora are typically sampled either by fecal collection, rectal swabbing, or by destructively sampling the intestinal contents of the host animal. Studies rarely include more than one sampling technique and no comparison of these methods currently exists for a wild mammal. Although some studies have hypothesized that the fecal microbiome is a nested subset of the intestinal microbiome, this hypothesis has not been formally tested. To address these issues, we examined guano (feces) and distal intestinal mucosa from 19 species of free-ranging bats from Lamanai, Belize, using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing to compare microbial communities across sample types. We found that the diversity and composition of intestine and guano samples differed substantially. In addition, we conclude that signatures of host evolution are retained by studying gut microbiomes based on mucosal tissue samples, but not fecal samples. Conversely, fecal samples retained more signal of host diet than intestinal samples. These results suggest that fecal and intestinal sampling methods are not interchangeable, and that these two microbiotas record different information about the host from which they are isolated.",animal,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29765359/

      Pseudogymnoascus destructans (Pd), the causative fungal agent of white-nose syndrome (WNS), has led to the deaths of millions of hibernating bats in the United States of America (USA) and Canada. Efficient strategies are needed to decontaminate Pd from the bat hibernacula to interrupt the disease transmission cycle without affecting the native microbes. Previously, we discovered a novel Trichoderma polysporum (Tp) strain (WPM 39143), which inhibited the growth of Pd in autoclaved soil samples. In the present investigation, we used culture-based approaches to determine Tp-induced killing of native and enriched Pd in the natural soil of two bat hibernacula. We also assessed the impact of Tp treatment on native microbial communities by metagenomics.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Our results demonstrated that Tp at the concentration of 105 conidia/g soil caused 100% killing of native Pd in culture within 5 weeks of incubation. A 10-fold higher concentration of Tp (106 conidia/g soil) killed an enriched Pd population (105 conidia/g soil). The 12,507 fungal operational taxonomic units (OTUs, dominated by Ascomycota and Basidiomycota) and 27,427 bacterial OTUs (dominated by Acidobacteria and Proteobacteria) comprised the native soil microbes of the two bat hibernacula. No significant differences in fungal and bacterial relative abundances were observed between untreated and Tp-treated soil (105 Tp conidia/g soil, p ≤ 0.05).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Our results suggest that Tp-induced killing of Pd is highly specific, with minimal to no impact on the indigenous microbes present in the soil samples. These findings provide the scientific rationale for the field trials of Tp in the WNS-affected hibernacula for the effective decontamination of Pd and the control of WNS.",,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30089518/

Microbial metacommunities may have important roles in host health through interactions with pathogens; however, it is unclear how pathogens affect host microbial metacommunities.

We sampled bat cutaneous microbial assemblages in the presence/absence of P. destructans and analyzed microbial metacommunity composition and relationships with structuring variables. Absence of P. destructans correlated with a metacommunity characterized by a common core microbial group that was lacking in disease positive bats. Additionally, P. destructans presence correlated with a change in the relationship between community structure and ecoregion.
