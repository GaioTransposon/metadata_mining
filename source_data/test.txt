study_STUDY_ABSTRACT=Cyanobacteria harmful algal bloom (cyanoHAB) species were isolated from Clear Lake, CA in August of 2019. Isolates 
were enriched in media and allowed to grow in the lab for several months before DNA was extracted for metagenomic sequencing. The goal of 
the project is to identify cyanoHAB species common to Clear Lake which experiences annual blooms.

experiment_DESIGN_DESCRIPTION=Surface samples were collected via bucket tow from Clear Lake in August of 2019. Colonies were hand picked 
and transferred into 50% C-N media. Enrichment cultures were allowed to grow for 7 months.  DNA was extracted and purified using the 
Qiagen DNEasy PowerBiofilm Kit  and sent to Novogene for metagenomic sequencing.
